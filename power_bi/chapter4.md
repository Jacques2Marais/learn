# Chapter 4: Data Transformation with Power Query Editor

Welcome to the heart of data preparation in Power BI: **Power Query Editor!**  This powerful tool is your data kitchen, where you clean, shape, and transform raw data into a delicious and insightful meal for Power BI to consume.

In this chapter, we'll explore the Power Query Editor interface and learn essential data transformation techniques that will dramatically improve the quality and usefulness of your Power BI reports.

## What is Power Query Editor?

**Power Query Editor is a data transformation and data preparation engine built into Power BI Desktop (and also available in Excel as "Get & Transform Data").** It provides a graphical, user-friendly interface for performing a wide range of data transformations without writing complex code (although it does have a powerful formula language called "M" for advanced transformations).

Think of Power Query Editor as your data chef. It allows you to:

*   **Clean Data:** Handle missing values, errors, inconsistencies, and unwanted characters.
*   **Shape Data:**  Restructure your data into the desired format, such as pivoting, unpivoting, and transposing tables.
*   **Transform Data:**  Modify data values, create new columns based on calculations, and change data types.
*   **Combine Data:** Merge and append data from multiple sources.
*   **Reduce Data:** Filter rows and columns to focus on relevant information and improve performance.

**Why is Data Transformation Important?**

Raw data is rarely perfect. It often suffers from issues like:

*   **Missing Values (Nulls):**  Gaps in your data where information is missing.
*   **Inconsistent Formatting:** Dates in different formats, inconsistent capitalization, varying units of measure.
*   **Errors:**  Data entry mistakes, calculation errors, or data corruption.
*   **Irrelevant Data:** Columns or rows that are not needed for your analysis.
*   **Data in the Wrong Shape:** Data structured in a way that's not optimal for analysis or visualization.

**Untransformed, "dirty" data can lead to:**

*   **Inaccurate Analysis:**  Misleading results and flawed insights.
*   **Poor Visualizations:**  Confusing or uninformative charts and graphs.
*   **Performance Issues:**  Slower report loading and interaction.
*   **Frustration and Wasted Time:**  Spending time fixing data issues downstream instead of focusing on analysis.

**Power Query Editor helps you avoid these problems by enabling you to proactively clean and prepare your data before it even reaches your Power BI reports.**

## Launching Power Query Editor

You typically launch Power Query Editor immediately after connecting to a data source.  As you learned in the previous chapter, when you use "Get Data" and select your data, you have the option to choose either "Load" or **"Transform Data."**

**Clicking "Transform Data" will open the Power Query Editor window.**

You can also launch Power Query Editor from within Power BI Desktop at any time:

*   **Home Ribbon:**  In the "Home" ribbon, in the "Queries" group, click **"Transform data"**.  (Note: the button might say "Edit Queries" in older versions of Power BI).

## Power Query Editor Interface Tour

**(Imagine a screenshot of Power Query Editor interface here with labels for each section)**

The Power Query Editor interface is designed for efficient data transformation.  Let's explore the key areas:

1.  **The Ribbon (Power Query Editor Ribbon):**  Similar to Power BI Desktop's ribbon, the Power Query Editor ribbon provides access to transformation commands, organized into tabs like "Home," "Transform," "Add Column," "View," and "Help."  These tabs contain the tools you'll use to manipulate your data.

2.  **The Query Pane (Queries List):**  Located on the left side, the Query pane lists all the queries in your Power BI project.  Each query represents a connection to a data source and the transformations applied to it. You can select a query to work on it in the main editor area.

3.  **The Data Preview Pane (Data Grid):**  The large central area displays a preview of your data *at the current step* in your transformation process.  It shows a sample of your data in a tabular format, allowing you to see the effects of your transformations in real-time.  **Important:** This is just a *preview* of your data, not the entire dataset (for performance reasons, especially with large datasets).

4.  **The Query Settings Pane (Applied Steps):**  Located on the right side, the Query Settings pane is crucial for understanding and managing your transformations.  It has two main sections:

    *   **Properties:**  Allows you to rename your query and add a description.
    *   **Applied Steps:** This is a chronological list of all the transformation steps you've applied to your data in the current query.  **This is the heart of Power Query's power and transparency!** Each step represents a transformation operation (e.g., "Removed Columns," "Changed Type," "Filtered Rows").  You can:
        *   **Select a step:** To see the data preview *at that step* in the transformation process.
        *   **Delete a step (using the "X" button):** To undo a transformation.
        *   **Right-click a step:** For options like renaming, deleting, or inserting steps.
        *   **Click the "Settings" icon (gear icon) next to a step:** To modify the settings of that specific transformation step (e.g., change the columns removed in a "Removed Columns" step).

5.  **The Formula Bar:** Located above the Data Preview pane, the Formula Bar displays the "M" code formula that corresponds to the currently selected step in the "Applied Steps" list.  While you don't need to write M code directly for most common transformations (Power Query Editor generates it for you), the Formula Bar is helpful for:
    *   **Understanding the M code behind transformations.**
    *   **Learning the M language for advanced transformations.**
    *   **Editing M code directly for fine-tuning or complex logic.**

## Common Data Transformation Operations

Power Query Editor offers a vast library of transformation operations. Here are some of the most common and essential ones you'll use frequently:

**Cleaning Data:**

*   **Removing Rows and Columns:**
    *   **Remove Columns:** Delete unnecessary columns to simplify your data and improve performance. (Home Ribbon -> Manage Columns -> Choose Columns -> Choose Columns to Remove OR Remove Columns -> Remove Columns / Remove Other Columns)
    *   **Remove Rows:** Delete rows based on criteria (e.g., blank rows, error rows, rows with specific values). (Home Ribbon -> Reduce Rows -> Remove Rows -> Remove Top Rows, Remove Bottom Rows, Remove Duplicates, Remove Blank Rows, Remove Errors, Keep Ranges of Rows, Keep Duplicates, Keep Errors)

*   **Handling Missing Values (Nulls):**
    *   **Replace Values:** Replace null values with a specific value (e.g., 0, "Unknown", the average value). (Home Ribbon -> Transform -> Replace Values)
    *   **Fill Down/Fill Up:**  Fill null values in a column based on the values in the rows above or below. Useful for hierarchical data. (Transform Ribbon -> Fill -> Fill Down / Fill Up)

*   **Error Handling:**
    *   **Remove Errors:** Delete rows that contain errors. (Home Ribbon -> Reduce Rows -> Remove Rows -> Remove Errors)
    *   **Replace Errors:** Replace errors with a specific value (e.g., 0, "Error Value"). (Home Ribbon -> Transform -> Replace Values -> Replace Errors)
    *   **Keep Errors:** Filter to keep only rows that contain errors for investigation. (Home Ribbon -> Reduce Rows -> Keep Rows -> Keep Errors)

*   **Text Transformations:**
    *   **Change Case:** Convert text to uppercase, lowercase, or proper case. (Transform Ribbon -> Format -> UPPERCASE / lowercase / Capitalize Each Word)
    *   **Trim:** Remove leading and trailing whitespace from text values. (Transform Ribbon -> Format -> Trim)
    *   **Clean:** Remove non-printable characters from text values. (Transform Ribbon -> Format -> Clean)
    *   **Extract:** Extract parts of text values based on delimiters, positions, or patterns. (Transform Ribbon -> Extract -> Text Before Delimiter, Text After Delimiter, Text Between Delimiters, Length, First Characters, Last Characters, Range)

*   **Data Type Conversions:**
    *   **Change Type:**  Ensure columns have the correct data type (e.g., Text, Number, Date, DateTime, Boolean).  Incorrect data types can cause errors or prevent calculations. (Home Ribbon -> Transform -> Data Type dropdown OR right-click on column header -> Change Type)

**Shaping Data:**

*   **Pivoting and Unpivoting:**
    *   **Pivot Column:** Transform unique values in a column into new columns. Useful for summarizing data. (Transform Ribbon -> Pivot Column)
    *   **Unpivot Columns:**  Convert multiple columns into rows. Useful for normalizing data and making it easier to work with in visualizations. (Transform Ribbon -> Unpivot Columns -> Unpivot Columns / Unpivot Other Columns / Unpivot Only Selected Columns)

*   **Transposing Tables:**  Swap rows and columns. (Transform Ribbon -> Transpose)

*   **Splitting Columns:**  Divide a single column into multiple columns based on delimiters or number of characters. (Home Ribbon -> Transform -> Split Column -> By Delimiter / By Number of Characters)

*   **Grouping Rows:**  Summarize data by grouping rows based on one or more columns and applying aggregate functions (e.g., sum, average, count). (Home Ribbon -> Transform -> Group By)

**Transforming Data:**

*   **Adding Custom Columns:** Create new columns based on formulas and calculations using the "M" language or using the "Add Column" ribbon for simpler operations. (Add Column Ribbon -> Custom Column / Conditional Column / Index Column / etc.)
*   **Conditional Columns:** Create new columns based on "if-then-else" logic. (Add Column Ribbon -> Conditional Column)
*   **Date and Time Transformations:** Extract date parts (year, month, day), calculate date differences, and perform other date-related operations. (Transform Ribbon -> Date and Time columns)
*   **Number Transformations:** Perform mathematical operations, rounding, and statistical calculations on numeric columns. (Transform Ribbon -> Number Columns -> Standard / Scientific / Rounding / Information)
*   **Merging Queries (Joining Tables):** Combine data from two or more queries based on matching columns (like SQL JOIN operations). (Home Ribbon -> Combine -> Merge Queries -> Merge Queries / Merge Queries as New)
*   **Appending Queries (Stacking Tables):** Combine rows from two or more queries into a single query (like SQL UNION operations). (Home Ribbon -> Combine -> Append Queries -> Append Queries / Append Queries as New)

## Applying Transformations: A Simple Example

Let's say you've imported a CSV file containing sales data with a "Date" column that is incorrectly recognized as text.  Here's how you'd fix it in Power Query Editor:

1.  **Launch Power Query Editor** after connecting to your CSV file.
2.  **Locate the "Date" column** in the Data Preview pane. You might see "ABC" icon in the column header, indicating it's currently Text data type.
3.  **Change Data Type:**
    *   **Method 1 (Ribbon):** Select the "Date" column. Go to the **Home Ribbon -> Transform -> Data Type** dropdown. Choose **"Date"** or **"DateTime"** (depending on if your date includes time information).
    *   **Method 2 (Right-Click):** Right-click on the "Date" column header.  Go to **"Change Type"** and select **"Date"** or **"DateTime."**
4.  **Applied Steps:**  Notice that a new step, **"Changed Type,"** has been added to the "Applied Steps" list in the Query Settings pane.  This step records your data type conversion.
5.  **Review Data:**  Check the Data Preview pane. The "Date" column should now have a calendar icon in the header, indicating it's correctly recognized as a Date or DateTime data type.

You've just performed your first data transformation in Power Query Editor!  This simple example demonstrates the basic workflow:

1.  **Select Data/Column(s).**
2.  **Choose Transformation Operation** from the Ribbon or right-click menus.
3.  **Review Applied Step and Data Preview.**
4.  **Repeat** for other transformations as needed.

## "Close & Apply" Your Transformations

Once you've completed all your desired data transformations in Power Query Editor, you need to bring the transformed data into your Power BI data model.

*   **Home Ribbon -> Close & Apply -> Close & Apply:**  This option saves all your transformations and loads the transformed data into Power BI Desktop's data model. You'll be taken back to the main Power BI Desktop Report View.
*   **Home Ribbon -> Close & Apply -> Apply:**  Applies the changes but keeps the Power Query Editor window open. Useful if you want to make further transformations.
*   **Home Ribbon -> Close & Apply -> Close without Apply:** Discards your changes and closes Power Query Editor without loading the transformed data.

**Always choose "Close & Apply" when you're ready to use your transformed data in Power BI reports.**
