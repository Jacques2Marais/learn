# Chapter 4: First and Second Declension Nouns

Welcome to Chapter 4! In this chapter, we will dive into the first and second declensions, which are the most common noun declensions in Latin. Mastering these declensions is crucial for building your vocabulary and understanding basic Latin sentence structure.

## 4.1 Introduction to Declensions Revisited

As we learned in Chapter 2, declensions are families of nouns that share similar patterns of case endings. Latin has five declensions, and we will start with the first two:

*   **First Declension:** Primarily feminine nouns, with a few masculine exceptions. Typically denote female beings, countries, cities, trees.
*   **Second Declension:** Masculine and neuter nouns. Masculine nouns often denote male beings, while neuter nouns often denote things or objects.

## 4.2 First Declension Nouns

First declension nouns are characterized by the nominative singular ending **-a**. The genitive singular ending is **-ae**. Most first declension nouns are feminine.

**Example: *puella, puellae* (girl)**

| Case        | Singular | Plural   |
| :---------- | :------- | :------- |
| Nominative  | *puell**a*** | *puell**ae*** |
| Genitive    | *puell**ae*** | *puell**ārum*** |
| Dative      | *puell**ae*** | *puell**īs*** |
| Accusative  | *puell**am*** | *puell**ās*** |
| Ablative    | *puell**ā***  | *puell**īs*** |
| Vocative    | *puell**a*** | *puell**ae*** |

**Key Endings for First Declension:**

| Case        | Singular | Plural   |
| :---------- | :------- | :------- |
| Nominative  | **-a**   | **-ae**  |
| Genitive    | **-ae**  | **-ārum**|
| Dative      | **-ae**  | **-īs**  |
| Accusative  | **-am**  | **-ās**  |
| Ablative    | **-ā**   | **-īs**  |
| Vocative    | **-a**   | **-ae**  |

**Vocabulary - First Declension Nouns (Feminine):**

*   ***aqua, aquae*** (f.) - water
*   ***terra, terrae*** (f.) - earth, land
*   ***via, viae*** (f.) - road, way
*   ***silva, silvae*** (f.) - forest, woods
*   ***puella, puellae*** (f.) - girl
*   ***familia, familiae*** (f.) - family
*   ***patria, patriae*** (f.) - fatherland, country

**Masculine Exceptions in First Declension:**

A few first declension nouns are masculine, typically referring to professions for men. The declension is the same, but the gender is masculine.

*   ***nauta, nautae*** (m.) - sailor
*   ***poeta, poetae*** (m.) - poet

## 4.3 Second Declension Nouns: Masculine

Second declension masculine nouns typically end in **-us** in the nominative singular and **-ī** in the genitive singular. The vocative singular often ends in **-e**.

**Example: *dominus, dominī* (lord, master)**

| Case        | Singular  | Plural    |
| :---------- | :-------- | :-------- |
| Nominative  | *domin**us*** | *domin**ī***   |
| Genitive    | *domin**ī***  | *domin**ōrum*** |
| Dative      | *domin**ō***  | *domin**īs***   |
| Accusative  | *domin**um*** | *domin**ōs***   |
| Ablative    | *domin**ō***  | *domin**īs***   |
| Vocative    | *domin**e***  | *domin**ī***   |

**Key Endings for Second Declension Masculine:**

| Case        | Singular | Plural   |
| :---------- | :------- | :------- |
| Nominative  | **-us**  | **-ī**   |
| Genitive    | **-ī**   | **-ōrum**|
| Dative      | **-ō**   | **-īs**  |
| Accusative  | **-um**  | **-ōs**  |
| Ablative    | **-ō**   | **-īs**  |

*   ***filius, filiī*** (m.) - son

*   ***ager, agrī*** (m.) - field, land (Note: *ager* drops the *-e-* in most forms after nominative singular)
*   ***puer, puerī*** (m.) - boy (Note: *puer* retains the *-e-* throughout declension)
*   ***vir, virī*** (m.) - man, hero

## 4.4 Second Declension Nouns: Neuter

Second declension neuter nouns typically end in **-um** in the nominative singular and **-ī** in the genitive singular. Neuter nouns have the special feature that their nominative and accusative cases are always the same, and in the plural, these cases end in **-a**.

**Example: *templum, templī* (temple)**

| Case        | Singular  | Plural    |
| :---------- | :-------- | :-------- |
| Nominative  | *templ**um*** | *templ**a***   |
| Genitive    | *templ**ī***  | *templ**ōrum*** |
| Dative      | *templ**ō***  | *templ**īs***   |
| Accusative  | *templ**um*** | *templ**a***   |
| Ablative    | *templ**ō***  | *templ**īs***   |
| Vocative    | *templ**um*** | *templ**a***   |

**Key Endings for Second Declension Neuter:**

| Case        | Singular | Plural   |
| :---------- | :------- | :------- |
| Nominative/Vocative/Accusative | **-um**  | **-a**   |
| Genitive    | **-ī**   | **-ōrum**|
| Dative      | **-ō**   | **-īs**  |
| Ablative    | **-ō**   | **-īs**  |

*   ***bellum, bellī*** (n.) - war

*   ***forum, forī*** (n.) - forum, public square
*   ***vinum, vinī*** (n.) - wine
*   ***caelum, caelī*** (n.) - sky, heaven

## 4.5 Noun-Adjective Agreement (Introduction)

In Latin, adjectives must agree with the nouns they modify in **gender**, **number**, and **case**. For now, we will just note this principle; we will study adjectives in detail in Chapter 9.

Example: *puella **bella*** (beautiful girl) - *bella* (beautiful) is a first declension adjective agreeing with *puella* (girl) in gender, number, and case (all nominative singular feminine).

## 4.6 Practice and Memorization

Memorizing the case endings for the first and second declensions is essential. Practice declining the example nouns and learn the vocabulary provided. Use flashcards, write out the declensions, and start trying to recognize these nouns in simple Latin sentences.

**Key Takeaways from Chapter 4:**

*   **First Declension** nouns are mostly feminine and use endings like *-a, -ae, -ae, -am, -ā, -a* (singular) and *-ae, -arum, -is, -as, -is, -ae* (plural).
*   **Second Declension Masculine** nouns use endings like *-us, -i, -o, -um, -o, -e* (singular) and *-i, -orum, -is, -os, -is, -i* (plural).
*   **Second Declension Neuter** nouns use endings like *-um, -i, -o, -um, -o, -um* (singular) and *-a, -orum, -is, -a, -is, -a* (plural).
*   Neuter nouns have the same form for nominative, accusative, and vocative, and in the plural these cases end in *-a*.
*   Adjectives must agree with nouns in gender, number, and case.

In the next chapter, we will learn the present tense of the verb *sum* (to be) and first conjugation verbs, and start forming simple Latin sentences using first and second declension nouns. *Sperāte*! (Hope on!)
