# Chapter 12: Gerunds and Gerundives

Welcome to Chapter 12! In this chapter, we will explore gerunds and gerundives, which are verbal nouns and adjectives respectively. These forms are unique to Latin and allow for concise and elegant expression of actions as nouns or adjectives, particularly in oblique cases (genitive, dative, accusative, ablative).

## 12.1 Gerunds: Verbal Nouns

Gerunds are verbal nouns, meaning they are derived from verbs but function as nouns. In Latin, gerunds are **neuter singular** forms and exist only in the **genitive, dative, accusative, and ablative cases**. They express the *action* of the verb in a noun form.

**Formation of Gerunds:**

1.  **Present Active Infinitive:** Take the present active infinitive (2nd principal part) of the verb.
    *   *amāre* (to love)
    *   *docēre* (to teach)
    *   *currere* (to run)
    *   *audīre* (to hear)

2.  **Remove the Infinitive Ending *-re*:** Remove *-re* from the infinitive to get the gerund stem.
    *   *amā-*
    *   *docē-*
    *   *curr-*
    *   *audī-*

3.  **Add Gerund Endings:** Add the gerund endings, which are similar to second declension neuter noun endings.

**Gerund Endings:**

| Case        | Ending | Example (*amō, amāre*) |
| :---------- | :----- | :--------------------- |
| Genitive    | *-ndī*  | *amā**ndī***          |
| Dative      | *-ndō*  | *amā**ndō***          |
| Accusative  | *-ndum* | *amā**ndum***         |
| Ablative    | *-ndō*  | *amā**ndō***          |

**Gerund Conjugations (examples):**

## 12.2 Gerundives: Verbal Adjectives

Gerundives (also called future passive participles or *nomina verbalia*) are verbal adjectives. They are derived from verbs and function as adjectives, modifying nouns and agreeing with them in gender, number, and case. Gerundives express the idea of **necessity** or **obligation** – "must be verb-ed" or "should be verb-ed."

**Formation of Gerundives:**

1.  **Present Active Infinitive:** Take the present active infinitive (2nd principal part).
    *   *amāre* (to love)
    *   *docēre* (to teach)
    *   *currere* (to run)
    *   *audīre* (to hear)

2.  **Remove the Infinitive Ending *-re*:** Remove *-re* from the infinitive to get the gerundive stem (same as gerund stem).
    *   *amā-*
    *   *docē-*
    *   *curr-*
    *   *audī-*

3.  **Add Gerundive Suffix and 1st/2nd Declension Adjective Endings:** Add the suffix **-nd-** and then decline as a 1st/2nd declension adjective (*bonus, bona, bonum*).

**Gerundive Endings (like *bonus, bona, bonum*):**

| Case        | Masculine | Feminine | Neuter  |
| :---------- | :-------- | :------- | :------ |
| Nominative  | *-ndus*  | *-nda*  | *-ndum* |
| Genitive    | *-ndī*   | *-ndae*  | *-ndī*  |
| Dative      | *-ndō*   | *-ndae*  | *-ndō*  |
| Accusative  | *-ndum*  | *-ndam*  | *-ndum* |
| Ablative    | *-ndō*   | *-ndā*   | *-ndō*  |
| Vocative    | *-nde*   | *-nda*  | *-ndum* |

**Gerundive Conjugations (examples - Nominative Singular):**

*   **1st Conjugation: *amō, amāre*** (to love)
    *   m. *amandus*, f. *amanda*, n. *amandum* - to be loved, deserving to be loved, must be loved

*   **2nd Conjugation: *doceō, docēre*** (to teach)
    *   m. *docendus*, f. *docenda*, n. *docendum* - to be taught, deserving to be taught, must be taught

*   **3rd Conjugation: *currō, currere*** (to run)
    *   m. *currendus*, f. *curenda*, n. *currendum* - to be run, deserving to be run, must be run

*   **4th Conjugation: *audiō, audīre*** (to hear)
    *   m. *audiendus*, f. *audienda*, n. *audiendum* - to be heard, deserving to be heard, must be heard


**Uses of Gerundives:**

*   **Passive Periphrastic Conjugation:** Gerundives are famously used with the verb *sum* to form the passive periphrastic conjugation, expressing necessity or obligation.
    *   ***Liber  legendus  est.*** - The book **must be read.** (literally: "The book is to-be-read.")
        *   *Liber* (book) - Nominative subject
        *   *legendus* (to-be-read) - Nominative masculine gerundive, agreeing with *liber*
        *   *est* (is) - form of *sum*

    *   ***Nobis  urbs  mūnienda  est.*** - **We must fortify the city.** (literally: "To-us the city is-to-be-fortified.")
        *   *Nobis* (to us) - Dative of agent (indicates who must perform the action)
        *   *urbs* (city) - Nominative subject (what must be fortified)
        *   *mūnienda* (to-be-fortified) - Nominative feminine gerundive, agreeing with *urbs*
        *   *est* (is) - form of *sum*

*   **Gerundive of Obligation (without *sum*):** Gerundives can also express obligation or necessity even without *sum*, acting as regular adjectives.
    *   *Tempus **agendum*** - Time **for acting** (Neuter accusative gerundive modifying *tempus*)
    *   *Rēs **agendae*** - Things **to be done** (Neuter nominative plural gerundive modifying *rēs*)
