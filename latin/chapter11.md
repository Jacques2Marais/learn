# Chapter 11: Subjunctive Mood (Introduction)

Welcome to Chapter 11! In this chapter, we will begin our exploration of the subjunctive mood. So far, we have been working with the indicative mood, which is used for factual statements and questions. The subjunctive mood, however, expresses actions or states that are potential, желаемые, or contrary to fact. It is used in various subordinate clauses and certain main clauses to express a range of nuances not conveyed by the indicative.

## 11.1 Introduction to Moods: Indicative vs. Subjunctive

Latin verbs have different **moods** that indicate the manner in which the action is presented. The primary moods are:

1.  **Indicative Mood:** Used for factual statements and questions. It states what is, was, or will be. (e.g., *Puella legit* - The girl is reading.)
2.  **Subjunctive Mood:** Used for potential, желаемые, hypothetical, or contrary-to-fact actions or states. It expresses what might be, what is wished for, or what is imagined. (e.g., *Puella legat* - May the girl read; If the girl should read)
3.  **Imperative Mood:** Used for commands. (e.g., *Lege!* - Read!)

In this chapter, we will focus on the **subjunctive mood**.

    *   Conditional Clauses (in certain types): Expressing hypothetical conditions (e.g., *si veniat, gaudeamus* - if he should come, let us rejoice)
    *   Relative Clauses of Characteristic: Describing a kind of person or thing (e.g., *Sunt qui hoc dicant* - There are some who may say this)
