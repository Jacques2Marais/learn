# Chapter 13: Indirect Statement and Purpose Clauses

Welcome to Chapter 13! In this chapter, we will delve into two important types of subordinate clauses: indirect statement and purpose clauses. These constructions are essential for expressing complex thoughts and relationships between actions in Latin.

## 13.1 Indirect Statement (Ōrātiō Obliqua)

Indirect statement, also known as reported speech, is used to report what someone says, thinks, feels, or perceives, **not in their own words, but from the reporter's perspective**. In Latin, indirect statement typically involves an **accusative and infinitive** construction and is introduced by verbs of saying, thinking, perceiving, etc. (verbs of "head" and "sense").

**Verbs Introducing Indirect Statement (Verba Dīcendī et Sentīendī):**

*   *dīcō, dīcere* - to say, tell
*   *putō, putāre* - to think, consider
*   *sciō, scīre* - to know
*   *audiō, audīre* - to hear
*   *videō, vidēre* - to see
*   *sentiō, sentīre* - to feel, perceive
*   *nūntiō, nūntiāre* - to announce, report
*   *crēdō, crēdere* - to believe
*   *spērō, spērāre* - to hope
*   *negō, negāre* - to deny

**Structure of Indirect Statement:**

1.  **Main Verb:** A verb of saying, thinking, perceiving, etc., in the indicative mood.
2.  **Accusative Subject:** The subject of the indirect statement is put in the **accusative case**. This is the person or thing that is said to be doing something or being something.
3.  **Infinitive Verb:** The verb of the indirect statement is put in the **infinitive mood**. The tense of the infinitive depends on its time relative to the main verb.

**Tenses of the Infinitive in Indirect Statement:**

*   **Present Infinitive:** Action happening at the same time as the main verb.
    *   *Dīcit puellam **legere*** - He says that the girl **is reading** (simultaneous action)

*   **Perfect Infinitive:** Action happening before the main verb.
    *   *Dīcit puellam **lēgisse*** - He says that the girl **has read/read** (action prior to saying)

*   **Future Infinitive:** Action happening after the main verb.
    *   *Dīcit puellam **lēctūram esse*** - He says that the girl **will read** (action after saying)

**Examples of Indirect Statement:**

1.  *Pater dīcit filium **valēre***. (Present Infinitive)
    *   *Pater dīcit* - Father says (main verb)
    *   *filium* - son (accusative subject)
    *   *valēre* - to be well (present infinitive)
    *   Translation: Father says that his son **is well**.

2.  *Puella audit dominum **venisse***. (Perfect Infinitive)
    *   *Puella audit* - The girl hears (main verb)
    *   *dominum* - the lord (accusative subject)
    *   *venisse* - to have come (perfect infinitive)
    *   Translation: The girl hears that the lord **has come**.

3.  *Nauta spērat sē **nāvigātūrum esse***. (Future Infinitive)
    *   *Nauta spērat* - The sailor hopes (main verb)
    *   *sē* - himself (accusative subject - reflexive pronoun referring back to *nauta*)
    *   *nāvigātūrum esse* - to be about to sail, will sail (future infinitive)
    *   Translation: The sailor hopes that he **will sail**.

4.  *Crēdō tē **errāre***. (Present Infinitive)
    *   *Crēdō* - I believe (main verb)
    *   *tē* - you (accusative subject)
    *   *errāre* - to be mistaken (present infinitive)
    *   Translation: I believe that you **are mistaken**.


## 13.2 Purpose Clauses (Clauses of Purpose)

Purpose clauses express the **purpose** or **reason** for which an action is performed in the main clause. They answer the question "why?" or "for what purpose?". Purpose clauses are introduced by *ut* (positive purpose - "in order that," "so that") or *nē* (negative purpose - "in order that not," "lest"). Purpose clauses use the **subjunctive mood**.

**Structure of Purpose Clauses:**

1.  **Main Clause Verb:** Verb in the indicative mood expressing the action.
2.  ***ut / nē***: Conjunction introducing the purpose clause.
3.  **Subjunctive Verb:** Verb in the subjunctive mood in the purpose clause. The tense of the subjunctive verb is determined by the sequence of tenses (related to the tense of the main verb).

**Sequence of Tenses (Simplified for Purpose Clauses):**

*   **Primary Sequence:** If the main verb is in a primary tense (present, future, future perfect, perfect [sometimes]), the subjunctive verb in the purpose clause is in the **present subjunctive**.
    *   *Venit ut **videat*** - He comes so that he **may see** (main verb *venit* - present)

*   **Secondary Sequence:** If the main verb is in a secondary tense (imperfect, perfect [sometimes], pluperfect), the subjunctive verb in the purpose clause is in the **imperfect subjunctive**.
    *   *Vēnit ut **vidēret*** - He came so that he **might see** (main verb *vēnit* - perfect)


**Examples of Purpose Clauses:**

1.  *Mīlitēs  veniunt  ut  urbem  **mūniant***. (Primary Sequence - Present Subjunctive)
    *   *Mīlitēs veniunt* - The soldiers come (main clause)
    *   *ut urbem mūniant* - so that they may fortify the city (purpose clause)
    *   Translation: The soldiers come **so that they may fortify the city**.

2.  *Lēgātus  missus  est  nē  bellum  **fieret***. (Secondary Sequence - Imperfect Subjunctive)
    *   *Lēgātus missus est* - The envoy was sent (main clause - passive perfect)
    *   *nē bellum fieret* - lest war should happen/break out (purpose clause)
    *   Translation: The envoy was sent **lest war should break out**. (*fieret* - imperfect subjunctive of *fiō, fierī* - to become, happen)

3.  *Discipulus  studet  ut  doctus  **sit***. (Primary Sequence - Present Subjunctive)
    *   *Discipulus studet* - The student studies (main clause)
    *   *ut doctus sit* - so that he may be learned (purpose clause)
    *   Translation: The student studies **so that he may be learned**. (*sit* - present subjunctive of *sum, esse*)

4.  *Cūrrimus  celeriter  ut  hostēs  **nōn  consequāmur***. (Primary Sequence - Present Subjunctive - Negative Purpose)
    *   *Cūrrimus celeriter* - We run quickly (main clause)
    *   *ut hostēs nōn consequāmur* - so that we may not be overtaken by the enemies (purpose clause - negative with *nōn*)
    *   Translation: We run quickly **so that we may not be overtaken by the enemies**. (*consequāmur* - present subjunctive passive of *consequor, consequī* - to overtake)


## 13.3 Practice and Sentence Construction

Practice identifying and constructing indirect statements and purpose clauses. Pay attention to the accusative and infinitive construction in indirect statement and the use of *ut/nē* and the subjunctive mood in purpose clauses. Translate sentences involving these clause types to solidify your understanding.

**Vocabulary - Additional Verbs and Conjunctions:**

*   ***fiō, fierī, factus sum*** (irregular passive of *faciō*) - to become, happen, be made, be done
*   ***consequor, consequī, consecutus sum*** (3rd conj. dep.) - to follow, overtake, achieve
*   ***rogō, rogāre, rogāvī, rogātus*** (1st conj.) - to ask, request
*   ***ut*** (conj.) - in order that, so that, that
*   ***nē*** (conj.) - in order that not, lest, that not

**Key Takeaways from Chapter 13:**

*   **Indirect Statement** reports speech/thought from reporter's perspective using accusative and infinitive, introduced by verbs of saying/thinking/perceiving.
*   Tense of infinitive in indirect statement depends on time relative to main verb (present, perfect, future infinitive).
*   **Purpose Clauses** express the purpose of an action, introduced by *ut/nē* and using the subjunctive mood.
*   Sequence of tenses determines subjunctive tense in purpose clauses (present subjunctive with primary tenses, imperfect subjunctive with secondary tenses in main clause).
*   Practice constructing and translating indirect statements and purpose clauses to enhance your complex sentence skills.
