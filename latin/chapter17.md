Latin literature spans over a millennium, from the earliest inscriptions to the Renaissance. Classical Latin literature typically refers to works from the Roman Republic (c. 240 BC - 27 BC) and the early Roman Empire (27 BC - 180 AD).

    *   **Late Republic (c. 80-27 BC):** Cicero (oratory, letters, philosophy), Caesar (historical narrative), Catullus (lyric poetry), Lucretius (didactic poetry), Sallust (historical narrative).
    *   **Augustan Age (c. 27 BC - 14 AD):** Virgil (epic, pastoral poetry), Horace (lyric poetry, satire), Ovid (love elegy, mythological epic), Livy (historical narrative), Propertius, Tibullus (love elegy).
