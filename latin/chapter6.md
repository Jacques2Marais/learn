# Chapter 6: Prepositions and Adverbs

Welcome to Chapter 6! In this chapter, we will expand our ability to form more complex Latin sentences by introducing prepositions and adverbs. These parts of speech add detail and nuance to our sentences, allowing us to express relationships between words and modify verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs.

## 6.1 Prepositions: Showing Relationships

Prepositions are words that show the relationship between a noun or pronoun (the object of the preposition) and another word in the sentence. In Latin, prepositions typically govern the accusative or ablative case.

**Prepositions taking the Accusative Case:**

These prepositions often indicate motion towards, direction, or extent.

*   ***ad*** (+ acc.) - to, towards, at
    *   Example: *ad urbem* (to the city)
*   ***ante*** (+ acc.) - before, in front of
    *   Example: *ante templum* (before the temple)
*   ***apud*** (+ acc.) - at, near, among, in the presence of
    *   Example: *apud amicos* (among friends)
*   ***circum*** (+ acc.) - around
    *   Example: *circum oppidum* (around the town)
*   ***contrā*** (+ acc.) - against, opposite to
    *   Example: *contrā dominum* (against the lord)
*   ***in*** (+ acc.) - into, onto (motion into)
    *   Example: *in silvam* (into the forest)
*   ***inter*** (+ acc.) - between, among
    *   Example: *inter viās* (between the roads)
*   ***per*** (+ acc.) - through, throughout
    *   Example: *per terram* (through the land)
*   ***post*** (+ acc.) - after, behind
    *   Example: *post bellum* (after the war)
*   ***prope*** (+ acc.) - near, close to
    *   Example: *prope aquam* (near the water)
*   ***trāns*** (+ acc.) - across, over
    *   Example: *trāns viam* (across the road)

**Prepositions taking the Ablative Case:**

These prepositions often indicate location, separation, or means.

*   ***ā / ab*** (+ abl.) - from, away from (used before consonants / vowels or 'h')
    *   Example: *ā silvā / ab urbe* (from the forest / from the city)
*   ***cum*** (+ abl.) - with
    *   Example: *cum amico* (with a friend)
*   ***dē*** (+ abl.) - from, down from, about, concerning
    *   Example: *dē caelo* (down from the sky), *dē bellō* (about the war)
*   ***ē / ex*** (+ abl.) - from, out of (used before consonants / vowels)
    *   Example: *ē forō / ex oppido* (from the forum / out of the town)
*   ***in*** (+ abl.) - in, on (location in)
    *   Example: *in terra* (in the land)
*   ***prō*** (+ abl.) - in front of, before, for, on behalf of
    *   Example: *prō templo* (in front of the temple), *prō patria* (for the fatherland)
*   ***sine*** (+ abl.) - without
    *   Example: *sine вино* (without wine)
*   ***sub*** (+ abl.) - under, beneath (location under)
    *   Example: *sub silvā* (under the forest)

**Note on *in* and *sub*:**  *in* and *sub* can take either the accusative or ablative case, depending on whether motion towards or location in/under is indicated.

*   *in urbem* (accusative) - into the city (motion towards)
*   *in urbe* (ablative) - in the city (location in)
*   *sub monte* (accusative) - up to under the mountain (motion towards)
*   *sub monte* (ablative) - under the mountain (location under)


## 6.2 Using Prepositions in Sentences

Prepositional phrases consist of a preposition followed by its object (a noun or pronoun in the correct case). These phrases act as adverbs or adjectives, modifying verbs, nouns, or sentences.

**Examples:**

1.  ***Puella  in silvā  ambulat.*** (The girl walks in the forest.)
    *   *in silvā* - prepositional phrase (in + ablative), adverbial, indicating place where

2.  ***Dominus  ad  templum  portat  dona.*** (The lord carries gifts to the temple.)
    *   *ad templum* - prepositional phrase (ad + accusative), adverbial, indicating direction

3.  ***Nautae  cum  amicis  nāvigant.*** (The sailors sail with friends.)
    *   *cum amicis* - prepositional phrase (cum + ablative), adverbial, indicating manner/accompaniment

4.  ***Bellum  contrā  patriam  est  malum.*** (War against the fatherland is bad.)
    *   *contrā patriam* - prepositional phrase (contrā + accusative), adjectival, modifying *bellum*

## 6.3 Adverbs: Modifying Verbs, Adjectives, and Adverbs

Adverbs modify verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs. They provide information about how, when, where, or to what extent an action is performed or a quality is described.

**Common Types of Adverbs:**

*   **Adverbs of Manner:** Describe *how* an action is done. Often derived from adjectives.
    *   ***bene*** - well
    *   ***male*** - badly
    *   ***celeriter*** - quickly
    *   ***lentē*** - slowly
    *   ***fortiter*** - bravely
    *   ***saepe*** - often

*   **Adverbs of Place:** Describe *where* an action happens.
    *   ***hic*** - here
    *   ***illic*** - there
    *   ***ubi*** - where
    *   ***eō*** - to there, thither
    *   ***hūc*** - to here, hither
    *   ***procul*** - far away

*   **Adverbs of Time:** Describe *when* an action happens.
    *   ***nunc*** - now
    *   ***tum*** - then
    *   ***semper*** - always
    *   ***numquam*** - never
    *   ***cotidie*** - daily
    *   ***mox*** - soon

*   **Adverbs of Degree:** Describe *to what extent*.
    *   ***valdē*** - very, very much
    *   ***maximē*** - very much, most
    *   ***minimē*** - very little, least
    *   ***paulum*** - a little
    *   ***nimis*** - too much

## 6.4 Using Adverbs in Sentences

Adverbs are generally placed near the words they modify. Adverbs modifying verbs can often be placed right before the verb.

**Examples:**

1.  ***Puella  celeriter  ambulat.*** (The girl walks quickly.)
    *   *celeriter* - adverb of manner, modifying *ambulat*

2.  ***Dominus  saepe  laudat  servum.*** (The lord often praises the slave.)
    *   *saepe* - adverb of frequency, modifying *laudat*

3.  ***Templum  illic  est  bellum.*** (The temple there is beautiful.)
    *   *illic* - adverb of place, modifying *est* (referring to the location of the temple)
    *   *bellum* - adjective, modifying *templum*

4.  ***Valdē  amo  patriam.*** (I love the fatherland very much.)
    *   *valdē* - adverb of degree, modifying *amo*

## 6.5 Practice and Sentence Expansion

Practice using prepositions and adverbs to expand your Latin sentences. Experiment with different prepositions to express various relationships and use adverbs to add detail to verb actions. Translate sentences incorporating prepositions and adverbs to solidify your understanding.

In the next chapter, we will move on to the third declension nouns, which are more varied and complex than the first and second declensions. *Proficere студете*! (Strive to make progress!)
