# Chapter 3: Verbs: Introduction to Conjugations and Tenses

Welcome to Chapter 3! In this chapter, we will introduce Latin verbs, the action words of the language. Understanding Latin verbs is crucial for constructing sentences and expressing actions in different tenses.

## 3.1 Verbs: Action Words

Verbs in Latin, as in English, express actions, states of being, or occurrences. Examples include *amare* (to love), *esse* (to be), *currere* (to run), and *docere* (to teach).

Latin verbs are categorized by **conjugation**, **tense**, **voice**, **mood**, and **person/number**. In this chapter, we will focus on conjugations and tenses.

## 3.2 Conjugations: Verb Families

Just like nouns have declensions, verbs have **conjugations**. Conjugations are families of verbs that share similar patterns of endings. There are four main conjugations in Latin, numbered 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th.  We will learn to identify them by their infinitive endings:

1.  **1st Conjugation:** Infinitives end in *-āre* (e.g., *am**āre*** - to love)
2.  **2nd Conjugation:** Infinitives end in *-ēre* (e.g., *doc**ēre*** - to teach)
3.  **3rd Conjugation:** Infinitives end in *-ere* (e.g., *curr**ere*** - to run)
4.  **4th Conjugation:** Infinitives end in *-īre* (e.g., *aud**īre*** - to hear)

There is also a **3rd Conjugation -iō** which is a variation of the 3rd conjugation, but we will address that later.

Knowing the conjugation of a verb is essential because it determines the set of endings it will use.

## 3.3 Principal Parts: Identifying Verbs

To fully identify a Latin verb and its conjugation, we use **principal parts**.  For regular verbs, there are four principal parts:

1.  **1st Principal Part:** **1st person singular, present active indicative** (Present tense, "I" form) - e.g., *am**ō*** (I love)
2.  **2nd Principal Part:** **Present active infinitive** (to + verb) - e.g., *am**āre*** (to love)
3.  **3rd Principal Part:** **1st person singular, perfect active indicative** (Perfect tense, "I have" form) - e.g., *am**āvī*** (I have loved)
4.  **4th Principal Part:** **Perfect passive participle** (having been + verb-ed) - e.g., *am**ātus*** (having been loved)

You will typically see verbs listed in dictionaries with these four principal parts. For example, for the verb "to love" (*amō, amāre, amāvī, amātus*).

For now, we will focus on the first two principal parts as they are most relevant for the present tense.

## 3.4 Tenses: Time of Action

Tenses indicate when the action of the verb takes place. Latin verbs have six main tenses in the indicative mood (the mood of factual statements):

**In the Active Voice (we will focus on active voice first):**

1.  **Present Tense:** Action happening now (e.g., "I love," "I am loving," "I do love")
2.  **Imperfect Tense:** Ongoing or repeated action in the past (e.g., "I was loving," "I used to love")
3.  **Future Tense:** Action that will happen in the future (e.g., "I will love")
4.  **Perfect Tense:** Completed action in the past, with present relevance (e.g., "I have loved," "I loved")
5.  **Pluperfect Tense:** Action completed before another past action (e.g., "I had loved")
6.  **Future Perfect Tense:** Action that will be completed in the future (e.g., "I will have loved")

In this chapter, we will focus on the **Present Tense**.

## 3.5 Present Tense: Active Voice

The present tense in Latin describes actions happening now. To conjugate a verb in the present tense, we need to:

1.  **Identify the Conjugation:** Look at the infinitive ending (-*āre*, -*ēre*, -*ere*, -*īre*) to determine the conjugation.
2.  **Find the Present Stem:** Remove the infinitive ending from the 2nd principal part to get the present stem.
    *   For 1st conjugation (*amāre*): stem is *amā-*
    *   For 2nd conjugation (*docēre*): stem is *docē-*
    *   For 3rd conjugation (*currere*): stem is *curr-*
    *   For 4th conjugation (*audīre*): stem is *audī-*
3.  **Add Present Active Endings:** Add the present active personal endings to the stem.

Here are the **Present Active Endings**:

| Person/Number | Ending | Example (1st Conjugation *amō*) | Translation        |
| :------------ | :----- | :----------------------------- | :----------------- |
| 1st Sing.     | *-ō*    | *am**ō***                       | I love, I am loving |
| 2nd Sing.     | *-s*    | *am**ās***                      | You love           |
| 3rd Sing.     | *-t*    | *am**at***                      | He/She/It loves    |
| 1st Plur.     | *-mus*  | *am**āmus***                     | We love            |
| 2nd Plur.     | *-tis*  | *am**ātis***                     | You (pl.) love     |
| 3rd Plur.     | *-nt*   | *am**ant***                      | They love          |

**Examples of Present Tense Conjugation:**

*   **1st Conjugation: *amō, amāre*** (to love)
    *   *amō* - I love
    *   *amās* - You love
    *   *amat* - He/She/It loves
    *   *amāmus* - We love
    *   *amātis* - You (pl.) love
    *   *amant* - They love

*   **2nd Conjugation: *doceō, docēre*** (to teach)
    *   *doceō* - I teach
    *   *docēs* - You teach
    *   *docet* - He/She/It teaches
    *   *docēmus* - We teach
    *   *docētis* - You (pl.) teach
    *   *docent* - They teach

*   **3rd Conjugation: *currō, currere*** (to run)
    *   *currō* - I run
    *   *curris* - You run
    *   *currit* - He/She/It runs
    *   *currimus* - We run
    *   *curritis* - You (pl.) run
    *   *currunt* - They run

*   **4th Conjugation: *audiō, audīre*** (to hear)
    *   *audiō* - I hear
    *   *audīs* - You hear
    *   *audit* - He/She/It hears
    *   *audīmus* - We hear
    *   *audītis* - You (pl.) hear
    *   *audiunt* - They hear

Notice the consistent endings across conjugations, with slight variations in the stem vowel.

## 3.6 Verb "to be": *sum, esse*

The verb "to be" (*sum, esse*) is irregular and very important. It is used to link subjects and predicates and to form compound verb tenses. Here is the present tense of *sum*:

*   *sum* - I am
*   *es* - You are
*   *est* - He/She/It is
*   *sumus* - We are
*   *estis* - You (pl.) are
*   *sunt* - They are

Memorize the present tense of *sum* as it is fundamental!

## 3.7 Practice and Usage

Understanding verb conjugations and tenses is a building block for Latin grammar. Practice conjugating verbs in the present tense and start using them in simple sentences.

**Key Takeaways from Chapter 3:**

*   Latin verbs have **conjugations** (1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th) identified by their infinitive endings.
*   **Principal parts** are used to identify verbs fully.
*   **Present tense** describes actions happening now.
*   Present tense is formed by adding **present active endings** to the **present stem**.
*   The verb "**to be**" (*sum, esse*) is irregular but essential.

In the next chapter, we will combine our knowledge of nouns and verbs to start forming complete Latin sentences and explore the first and second declension nouns. *Valete*! (Farewell, plural!)
