# Chapter 8: Imperfect and Future Tenses

Welcome to Chapter 8! In this chapter, we will expand our knowledge of verb tenses by learning the imperfect and future tenses in the active voice. These tenses allow us to express actions that were ongoing in the past (imperfect) and actions that will happen in the future (future).

## 8.1 Imperfect Tense: Past Continuous Action

The imperfect tense in Latin describes actions that were ongoing or repeated in the past. It is often translated as "was/were verb-ing" or "used to verb."

**Formation of Imperfect Tense (Active Voice):**

1.  **Identify the Present Stem:** As in the present tense, find the present stem by removing the infinitive ending from the 2nd principal part.
    *   1st Conjugation (*amāre*): stem = *amā-*
    *   2nd Conjugation (*docēre*): stem = *docē-*
    *   3rd Conjugation (*currere*): stem = *curr-*
    *   4th Conjugation (*audīre*): stem = *audī-*

2.  **Add the Imperfect Tense Sign:** For all conjugations, the tense sign for the imperfect is **-bā-**.

3.  **Add Personal Endings:** Add the active personal endings: *-m, -s, -t, -mus, -tis, -nt*.

**Imperfect Active Endings:**

| Person/Number | Ending |
| :------------ | :----- |
| 1st Sing.     | *-m*    |
| 2nd Sing.     | *-s*    |
| 3rd Sing.     | *-t*    |
| 1st Plur.     | *-mus*  |
| 2nd Plur.     | *-tis*  |
| 3rd Plur.     | *-nt*   |

## 8.3 Using Imperfect and Future Tenses in Sentences

Now we can form sentences describing past ongoing actions and future actions.

**Examples - Imperfect Tense:**

1.  ***Puella  in silvā  ambulābat.*** (The girl was walking in the forest.)
2.  ***Dominus  servum  saepe  laudābat.*** (The lord was often praising the slave.)
3.  ***Nautae  vinum  bibēbant.*** (The sailors were drinking wine.) (*bibō, bibere* - 3rd conj. - to drink)
4.  ***Urbs  erat  bella.*** (The city was beautiful.)

**Examples - Future Tense:**

1.  ***Puella  ad  viam  ambulābit.*** (The girl will walk to the road.)
2.  ***Dominus  servum  laudābit.*** (The lord will praise the slave.)
3.  ***Nautae  nāvigābunt.*** (The sailors will sail.)
4.  ***Templum  erit  magnificum.*** (The temple will be magnificent.)

## 8.4 Practice and Sentence Building

Practice conjugating verbs in the imperfect and future tenses. Translate sentences using these tenses from English to Latin and vice versa. Pay attention to the different future tense formations for 1st/2nd and 3rd/4th conjugations.

**Vocabulary - Additional Verbs (all conjugations):**

*   ***bibō, bibere, bibī, bibitus*** (3rd conj.) - to drink
*   ***videō, vidēre, vīdī, visus*** (2nd conj.) - to see
*   ***capiō, capere, cēpī, captus*** (3rd conj. -iō) - to take, seize
*   ***mūniō, mūnīre, mūnīvī, mūnītus*** (4th conj.) - to fortify, build

**Key Takeaways from Chapter 8:**

*   **Imperfect tense** describes ongoing past actions, formed with tense sign **-bā-** and personal endings.
*   **Future tense** describes future actions, with different formations for 1st/2nd and 3rd/4th conjugations.
*   Imperfect of *sum* is *eram, eras, erat, eramus, eratis, erant*.
*   Future of *sum* is *ero, eris, erit, erimus, eritis, erunt*.
*   Practice using imperfect and future tenses in sentences to expand your expressive range in Latin.

In the next chapter, we will learn about adjectives and adjective agreement, further enriching our ability to describe nouns in Latin. *Ad futura спегате*! (Hope for the future!)
