# Chapter 10: Perfect, Pluperfect, and Future Perfect Tenses; Passive Voice

Welcome to Chapter 10! In this chapter, we will complete our exploration of the six indicative tenses in the active voice by learning the perfect, pluperfect, and future perfect tenses. We will also begin our introduction to the passive voice, which allows us to express actions where the subject is acted upon, rather than performing the action.

## 10.1 Perfect Tense: Completed Action in the Present

The perfect tense in Latin describes an action completed in the past that has a connection to the present. It is often translated as "have/has verb-ed" or simply "verb-ed."

**Formation of Perfect Tense (Active Voice):**

1.  **Identify the Perfect Stem:** The perfect stem is found in the **3rd principal part** of the verb. Remove the *-ī* ending from the 3rd principal part.
    *   1st Conjugation (*amō, amāre, **amāvī**, amātus*): perfect stem = *amāv-*
    *   2nd Conjugation (*doceō, docēre, **docuī**, doctus*): perfect stem = *docu-*
    *   3rd Conjugation (*currō, currere, **cucurrī**, cursus*): perfect stem = *cucurr-*
    *   4th Conjugation (*audiō, audīre, **audīvī**, auditus*): perfect stem = *audīv-*

2.  **Add Perfect Active Endings:** Add the perfect active personal endings to the perfect stem.

**Perfect Active Endings:**

| Person/Number | Ending |
| :------------ | :----- |
| 1st Sing.     | *-ī*    |
| 2nd Sing.     | *-istī* |
| 3rd Sing.     | *-it*  |
| 1st Plur.     | *-imus*|
| 2nd Plur.     | *-istis*|
| 3rd Plur.     | *-ērunt*|

## 10.4 Introduction to the Passive Voice

In the active voice, the subject performs the action (e.g., "The girl loves"). In the **passive voice**, the subject receives the action (e.g., "The girl is loved"). We will begin our introduction to the passive voice in this chapter, focusing on the present passive indicative.

**Formation of Present Passive Indicative:**

1.  **Present Stem:** (same as present active)
2.  **Present Passive Endings:** Add the present passive personal endings to the present stem.

**Present Passive Endings:**

| Person/Number | Ending |
| :------------ | :----- |
| 1st Sing.     | *-or*   |
| 2nd Sing.     | *-ris*  |
| 3rd Sing.     | *-tur*  |
| 1st Plur.     | *-mur*  |
| 2nd Plur.     | *-minī*|
| 3rd Plur.     | *-ntur* |

## 10.5 Practice and Sentence Construction

Practice conjugating verbs in the perfect, pluperfect, and future perfect active tenses, and the present passive tense. Begin to construct sentences using these tenses, and translate sentences between English and Latin.

**Vocabulary - Additional Verbs (all conjugations):**

*   ***mittō, mittere, mīsī, missus*** (3rd conj.) - to send
*   ***teneō, tenēre, tenuī, tentus*** (2nd conj.) - to hold, keep
*   ***pōnō, pōnere, posuī, positus*** (3rd conj.) - to put, place
*   ***veniō, venīre, vēnī, ventus*** (4th conj.) - to come

**Key Takeaways from Chapter 10:**

*   **Perfect tense** (active) describes completed action with present relevance, formed with **perfect stem** and **perfect active endings**.
*   **Pluperfect tense** (active) describes action completed before the past, formed with **perfect stem**, **-era-**, and imperfect endings.
*   **Future perfect tense** (active) describes action completed in the future, formed with **perfect stem**, **-eri-**, and future endings.
*   **Present passive tense** describes subject receiving action in the present, formed with **present stem** and **present passive endings**.
*   Practice all six indicative active tenses and the present passive to expand your Latin verb skills.

In the next chapter, we will continue our study of the passive voice, learning the imperfect and future passive tenses. *Ad summa nītīmini*! (Strive for the highest things!)
