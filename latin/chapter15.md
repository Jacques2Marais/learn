# Chapter 15: Conditional Sentences

Welcome to Chapter 15! In this chapter, we will explore conditional sentences, also known as "if-then" sentences. Conditional sentences express conditions under which an action in the main clause will occur. Latin has several types of conditional sentences, each with its own structure and nuance.

## 15.1 Types of Conditional Sentences

Conditional sentences in Latin are classified into three main types based on the **degree of reality or possibility** expressed in the condition:

1.  **Simple Fact Conditionals (Real Conditionals):** Express conditions that are assumed to be true or possible in reality. Use indicative mood in both clauses.
2.  **Present Contrary to Fact Conditionals (Unreal Conditionals):** Express conditions that are contrary to present reality. Use subjunctive mood in both clauses (present subjunctive).
3.  **Past Contrary to Fact Conditionals (Unreal Conditionals):** Express conditions that were contrary to past reality. Use subjunctive mood in both clauses (imperfect or pluperfect subjunctive).
4.  **Future Less Vivid Conditionals (Potential Conditionals):** Express conditions that are less likely or merely potential in the future. Use subjunctive mood in both clauses (present subjunctive).
5.  **Future More Vivid Conditionals (Vivid Future Conditionals):** Express conditions that are expected or more vivid in the future. Use future indicative in the *if*-clause and future indicative or imperative in the *then*-clause.

## 15.2 Simple Fact Conditionals (Real Conditionals)

Simple fact conditionals state a direct factual relationship between the *if*-clause (protasis) and the *then*-clause (apodosis).

*   **Moods:** Indicative in both protasis and apodosis.
*   **Conjunction:** *sī* (if), *nisi* or *sī nōn* (if not, unless)
*   **Tenses:** Any indicative tense can be used, but tenses in both clauses are usually in the same time frame (present-present, past-past, future-future).

**Examples of Simple Fact Conditionals:**

1.  *Sī  valēs,  bene  est.* (Present - Present)
    *   *Sī valēs* - If you are well (protasis - present indicative)
    *   *bene est* - it is good (apodosis - present indicative)
    *   Translation: **If you are well, it is good.**

2.  *Sī  vēnit,  eum  vīdī.* (Perfect - Perfect)
    *   *Sī vēnit* - If he came (protasis - perfect indicative)
    *   *eum vīdī* - I saw him (apodosis - perfect indicative)
    *   Translation: **If he came, I saw him.**

3.  *Sī  veniet,  eum  vidēbō.* (Future - Future)
    *   *Sī veniet* - If he comes/will come (protasis - future indicative)
    *   *eum vidēbō* - I will see him (apodosis - future indicative)
    *   Translation: **If he comes, I will see him.**


## 15.3 Present Contrary to Fact Conditionals (Unreal Conditionals)

Present contrary to fact conditionals describe situations that are **not true in the present**. They express what *would be* happening *now* if the present reality were different.

*   **Moods:** Present subjunctive in both protasis and apodosis.
*   **Conjunction:** *sī* (if)
*   **Tense:** Present subjunctive in both clauses.

**Examples of Present Contrary to Fact Conditionals:**

1.  *Sī  rēx  essem,  omnia  rēgerem.*
    *   *Sī rēx essem* - If I were king (protasis - present subjunctive of *sum*)
    *   *omnia rēgerem* - I would rule all (apodosis - imperfect subjunctive of *regō*)
    *   Translation: **If I were king, I would rule everything.** (But I am not king now)

2.  *Sī  hoc  dīceret,  errāret.*
    *   *Sī hoc dīceret* - If he were to say this (protasis - imperfect subjunctive of *dīcō*)
    *   *errāret* - he would be mistaken (apodosis - imperfect subjunctive of *errō*)
    *   Translation: **If he were to say this, he would be mistaken.** (But he is not saying it, or if he did, he would be mistaken)


## 15.4 Past Contrary to Fact Conditionals (Unreal Conditionals)

Past contrary to fact conditionals describe situations that were **not true in the past**. They express what *would have happened* *then* if past circumstances had been different.

*   **Moods:** Pluperfect subjunctive in protasis, imperfect or pluperfect subjunctive in apodosis.
*   **Conjunction:** *sī* (if)
*   **Tense:** Pluperfect subjunctive in protasis, imperfect or pluperfect subjunctive in apodosis.

**Examples of Past Contrary to Fact Conditionals:**

1.  *Sī  vēnissēs,  mē  vidissēs.* (Pluperfect Subjunctive - Pluperfect Subjunctive)
    *   *Sī vēnissēs* - If you had come (protasis - pluperfect subjunctive of *veniō*)
    *   *mē vidissēs* - you would have seen me (apodosis - pluperfect subjunctive of *videō*)
    *   Translation: **If you had come, you would have seen me.** (But you did not come)

2.  *Sī  rex  fuissēs,  omnia  rēgissēs.* (Pluperfect Subjunctive - Pluperfect Subjunctive)
    *   *Sī rex fuissēs* - If you had been king (protasis - pluperfect subjunctive of *sum*)
    *   *omnia rēgissēs* - you would have ruled everything (apodosis - pluperfect subjunctive of *regō*)
    *   Translation: **If you had been king, you would have ruled everything.** (But you were not king)

3.  *Sī  vēnissēs,  nōn  tamen  eum  vidērēs.* (Pluperfect Subjunctive - Imperfect Subjunctive)
    *   *Sī vēnissēs* - If you had come (protasis - pluperfect subjunctive of *veniō*)
    *   *nōn tamen eum vidērēs* - you still would not see him (apodosis - imperfect subjunctive of *videō*)
    *   Translation: **Even if you had come, you still would not see him.**


## 15.5 Future Less Vivid Conditionals (Potential Conditionals)

Future less vivid conditionals express **less probable or potential future conditions**. They describe what *would happen* *in the future* if something *were to happen*.

*   **Moods:** Present subjunctive in both protasis and apodosis.
*   **Conjunction:** *sī* (if)
*   **Tense:** Present subjunctive in both clauses.

**Examples of Future Less Vivid Conditionals:**

1.  *Sī  hoc  dicās,  errēs.*
    *   *Sī hoc dicās* - If you should say this (protasis - present subjunctive of *dīcō*)
    *   *errēs* - you would be mistaken (apodosis - present subjunctive of *errō*)
    *   Translation: **If you should say this, you would be mistaken.** (Less vivid future possibility)

2.  *Sī  valeam,  veniā
