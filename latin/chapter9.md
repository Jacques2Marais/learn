# Chapter 9: Adjectives and Agreement

Welcome to Chapter 9! In this chapter, we will explore Latin adjectives and the crucial concept of adjective agreement. Adjectives are words that describe nouns, adding detail and color to our sentences. Understanding how adjectives agree with nouns is essential for constructing grammatically correct and descriptive Latin phrases.

## 9.1 Adjectives: Descriptive Words

Adjectives in Latin, like in English, modify nouns by describing their qualities or characteristics. Examples include *bonus* (good), *malus* (bad), *magnus* (great, large), *parvus* (small), *bellus* (beautiful), and *fortis* (brave, strong).

Latin adjectives, unlike English adjectives, **must agree with the nouns they modify in gender, number, and case**. This is known as **adjective agreement**.

## 9.2 Declension of Adjectives

Most Latin adjectives are declined like first and second declension nouns. We say they are **1st/2nd declension adjectives**.

*   **Masculine adjectives** are declined like second declension masculine nouns (*dominus*).
*   **Feminine adjectives** are declined like first declension nouns (*puella*).
*   **Neuter adjectives** are declined like second declension neuter nouns (*templum*).

Because of this, adjectives have different forms depending on the gender, number, and case of the noun they modify.

**Example: *bonus, bona, bonum* (good)**

This adjective has three forms listed in the dictionary to represent the masculine, feminine, and neuter nominative singular:

*   ***bonus*** (m.) - masculine form
*   ***bona*** (f.) - feminine form
*   ***bonum*** (n.) - neuter form

**Declension of *bonus, bona, bonum***

| Case        | Masculine Singular | Feminine Singular | Neuter Singular | Masculine Plural | Feminine Plural | Neuter Plural |
| :---------- | :----------------- | :---------------- | :-------------- | :--------------- | :-------------- | :------------ |
| Nominative  | *bon**us***        | *bon**a***         | *bon**um***       | *bon**ī***        | *bon**ae***       | *bon**a***      |
| Genitive    | *bon**ī***         | *bon**ae***        | *bon**ī***        | *bon**ōrum***     | *bon**ārum***    | *bon**ōrum***   |
| Dative      | *bon**ō***         | *bon**ae***        | *bon**ō***        | *bon**īs***       | *bon**īs***      | *bon**īs***     |
| Accusative  | *bon**um***        | *bon**am***        | *bon**um***       | *bon**ōs***       | *bon**ās***      | *bon**a***      |
| Ablative    | *bon**ō***         | *bon**ā***         | *bon**ō***        | *bon**īs***       | *bon**īs***      | *bon**īs***     |
| Vocative    | *bon**e***         | *bon**a***         | *bon**um***       | *bon**ī***        | *bon**ae***       | *bon**a***      |

Notice how the endings follow the patterns of 2nd declension masculine, 1st declension, and 2nd declension neuter nouns.

## 9.3 Adjective Agreement: Gender, Number, Case

Adjectives must agree with the nouns they modify in **gender**, **number**, and **case**. This means the adjective's form must match the noun's in all three of these grammatical categories.

**Steps for Adjective Agreement:**

1.  **Identify the noun** being modified.
2.  Determine the noun's **gender**, **number**, and **case**.
3.  Choose the adjective form that matches the noun's gender, number, and case from the adjective's declension paradigm.

**Examples of Adjective Agreement:**

1.  ***puella  bona*** (a good girl)
    *   *puella* (girl) - feminine, singular, nominative
    *   *bona* (good) - **feminine, singular, nominative** form of *bonus*

2.  ***dominus  bonus*** (a good lord)
    *   *dominus* (lord) - masculine, singular, nominative
    *   *bonus* (good) - **masculine, singular, nominative** form of *bonus*

3.  ***templum  bonum*** (a good temple)
    *   *templum* (temple) - neuter, singular, nominative
    *   *bonum* (good) - **neuter, singular, nominative** form of *bonus*

4.  ***puellae  bonae*** (good girls)
    *   *puellae* (girls) - feminine, plural, nominative
    *   *bonae* (good) - **feminine, plural, nominative** form of *bonus*

5.  ***dominōs  bonōs*** (good lords)
    *   *dominōs* (lords) - masculine, plural, accusative
    *   *bonōs* (good) - **masculine, plural, accusative** form of *bonus*

6.  ***templīs  bonīs*** (to/for good temples)
    *   *templīs* (temples) - neuter, plural, dative
    *   *bonīs* (good) - **neuter, plural, dative** form of *bonus*

## 9.4 Placement of Adjectives

Adjectives in Latin can be placed **before or after** the noun they modify.

*   **Attributive Adjectives:** These adjectives simply describe a quality of the noun and are often placed **before** the noun.
    *   Example: ***magna  urbs*** (a great city) - adjective *magna* (great) placed before noun *urbs* (city)

*   **Predicate Adjectives:** When an adjective is used with a linking verb (like *sum* - to be) to describe the subject, it is called a predicate adjective and is often placed **after** the verb.
    *   Example: *Urbs  est  ***magna***.* (The city is great.) - adjective *magna* (great) is a predicate adjective, placed after the verb *est* (is).

However, word order is flexible, and adjectives can be placed for emphasis or stylistic variation.

## 9.5 Vocabulary - 1st/2nd Declension Adjectives

Here are some common 1st/2nd declension adjectives with their masculine, feminine, and neuter nominative singular forms:

*   ***bonus, bona, bonum*** - good
*   ***malus, mala, malum*** - bad
*   ***magnus, magna, magnum*** - great, large
*   ***parvus, parva, parvum*** - small
*   ***bellus, bella, bellum*** - beautiful, handsome, pretty
*   ***lātus, lāta, lātum*** - wide, broad
*   ***longus, longa, longum*** - long
*   ***altus, alta, altum*** - high, deep
*   ***novus, nova, novum*** - new
*   ***antīquus, antīqua, antīquum*** - ancient, old
*   ***certus, certa, certum*** - certain, sure
*   ***cārus, cāra, cārum*** - dear, beloved

## 9.6 Practice and Sentence Enrichment

Practice declining adjectives and ensuring they agree with nouns in sentences. Translate phrases and sentences using adjectives, paying close attention to gender, number, and case agreement. Experiment with placing adjectives before and after nouns.

**Examples for Practice:**

*   good king (*rex bonus*)
*   beautiful sea (*mare bellum*)
*   great city (accusative) (*magnam urbem*)
*   to/for small towns (*parvis oppidis*)
*   ancient roads (*antīquae viae*)
*   dear friend (vocative) (*cāre amice*)

**Key Takeaways from Chapter 9:**

*   Latin adjectives describe nouns and must agree with them in **gender, number, and case**.
*   Most adjectives are **1st/2nd declension adjectives**, declined like 1st and 2nd declension nouns.
*   Adjective agreement is crucial for grammatical correctness.
*   Adjectives can be **attributive** (often before noun) or **predicate** (often after linking verb).
*   Practice adjective declension and agreement to enhance your Latin descriptions.
