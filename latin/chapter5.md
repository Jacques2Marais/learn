# Chapter 5: Present Tense of *sum* and First Conjugation Verbs

Welcome to Chapter 5! In this chapter, we will combine our knowledge of nouns and verbs to start forming simple Latin sentences. We will focus on the present tense of the irregular verb *sum* (to be) and learn to conjugate regular first conjugation verbs in the present tense.

## 5.1 Present Tense of *sum* (to be) - Revisited

As introduced in Chapter 3, the verb *sum, esse* (to be) is irregular but fundamental. Here is the present tense conjugation again for easy reference:

| Person/Number | Latin Form | English Translation |
| :------------ | :--------- | :------------------ |
| 1st Sing.     | *sum*      | I am                |
| 2nd Sing.     | *es*       | You are              |
| 3rd Sing.     | *est*      | He/She/It is         |
| 1st Plur.     | *sumus*    | We are               |
| 2nd Plur.     | *estis*    | You (pl.) are        |
| 3rd Plur.     | *sunt*     | They are              |

Memorize these forms! They are essential for forming sentences and will be used extensively throughout your Latin studies.

## 5.2 First Conjugation Verbs: Present Tense

First conjugation verbs, as we learned in Chapter 3, have infinitives ending in *-āre*. To conjugate them in the present tense, we use the present active endings: *-ō, -s, -t, -mus, -tis, -nt* and attach them to the present stem. The present stem is found by removing *-āre* from the infinitive.

**Example: *amō, amāre, amāvī, amātus* (to love)**

1.  **Infinitive:** *amāre*
2.  **Present Stem:** *amā-*
3.  **Present Tense Conjugation:**

    | Person/Number | Latin Form | English Translation |
    | :------------ | :--------- | :------------------ |
    | 1st Sing.     | *am**ō***    | I love, I am loving   |
    | 2nd Sing.     | *am**ās***   | You love             |
    | 3rd Sing.     | *am**at***   | He/She/It loves      |
    | 1st Plur.     | *am**āmus***  | We love              |
    | 2nd Plur.     | *am**ātis***  | You (pl.) love       |
    | 3rd Plur.     | *am**ant***   | They love            |

**More First Conjugation Verb Examples:**

*   ***portō, portāre, portāvī, portātus*** (to carry)
    *   *portō, portās, portat, portāmus, portātis, portant*
*   ***spectō, spectāre, spectāvī, spectātus*** (to watch, look at)
    *   *spectō, spectās, spectat, spectāmus, spectātis, spectant*
*   ***laudō, laudāre, laudāvī, laudātus*** (to praise)
    *   *laudō, laudās, laudat, laudāmus, laudātis, laudant*
*   ***parō, parāre, parāvī, parātus*** (to prepare)
    *   *parō, parās, parat, parāmus, parātis, parant*
*   ***nāvigō, nāvigāre, nāvigāvī, nāvigātus*** (to sail)
    *   *nāvigō, nāvigās, nāvigat, nāvigāmus, nāvigātis, nāvigant*

## 5.3 Basic Sentence Structure: Subject-Verb

The most basic Latin sentence consists of a subject and a verb. In Latin, the **verb ending** indicates the **person** and **number** of the subject, so you often don't need a separate subject pronoun (like *I, you, he* in English), although pronouns can be used for emphasis.

**Examples:**

1.  ***Puella  amat.*** (The girl loves.)
    *   *Puella* (girl) - nominative singular, subject
    *   *amat* (loves) - 3rd person singular verb

2.  ***Dominus  portat.*** (The lord carries.)
    *   *Dominus* (lord) - nominative singular, subject
    *   *portat* (carries) - 3rd person singular verb

3.  ***Nautae  nāvigant.*** (The sailors sail.)
    *   *Nautae* (sailors) - nominative plural, subject
    *   *nāvigant* (sail) - 3rd person plural verb

4.  ***Sumus  amici.*** (We are friends.)
    *   *Sumus* (are) - 1st person plural of *sum*
    *   *amici* (friends) - nominative plural, predicate nominative (more on this below)

## 5.4 Sentences with Predicate Nominatives

When using the verb *sum* (to be), you can have a **predicate nominative**, which renames or describes the subject. The predicate nominative is in the **nominative case**, just like the subject.

**Examples:**

1.  ***Puella  est  poeta.*** (The girl is a poet.)
    *   *Puella* (girl) - nominative singular, subject
    *   *est* (is) - 3rd person singular of *sum*
    *   *poeta* (poet) - nominative singular, predicate nominative

2.  ***Dominus  est  amicus.*** (The lord is a friend.)
    *   *Dominus* (lord) - nominative singular, subject
    *   *est* (is) - 3rd person singular of *sum*
    *   *amicus* (friend) - nominative singular, predicate nominative

3.  ***Terra  est  patria.*** (The land is a fatherland/country.)
    *   *Terra* (land) - nominative singular, subject
    *   *est* (is) - 3rd person singular of *sum*
    *   *patria* (fatherland) - nominative singular, predicate nominative

4.  ***Pueri  sunt  nautae.*** (The boys are sailors.)
    *   *Pueri* (boys) - nominative plural, subject
    *   *sunt* (are) - 3rd person plural of *sum*
    *   *nautae* (sailors) - nominative plural, predicate nominative

## 5.5 Word Order in Latin Sentences

Latin word order is more flexible than English because case endings indicate grammatical function. However, the **basic word order** is often **Subject-Object-Verb (SOV)**, though variations are common for emphasis or stylistic reasons. For simple sentences at this stage, Subject-Verb or Subject-Predicate Verb is sufficient.

## 5.6 Practice and Sentence Building

Practice conjugating first conjugation verbs in the present tense and using them with first and second declension nouns to build simple sentences. Translate sentences from English to Latin and vice versa. Focus on getting the noun cases and verb endings correct.

**Vocabulary - First Conjugation Verbs:**

*   ***amō, amāre, amāvī, amātus*** - to love
*   ***portō, portāre, portāvī, portātus*** - to carry
*   ***spectō, spectāre, spectāvī, spectātus*** - to watch, look at
*   ***laudō, laudāre, laudāvī, laudātus*** - to praise
*   ***parō, parāre, parāvī, parātus*** - to prepare
*   ***nāvigō, nāvigāre, nāvigāvī, nāvigātus*** - to sail
*   ***vocō, vocāre, vocāvī, vocātus*** - to call, summon

**Key Takeaways from Chapter 5:**

*   Present tense of *sum* (*sum, es, est, sumus, estis, sunt*) is essential.
*   First conjugation verbs in present tense are formed by adding present active endings to the present stem.
*   Basic Latin sentences consist of Subject-Verb.
*   Predicate nominatives with *sum* are in the nominative case.
*   Latin word order is flexible, but Subject-Verb is a common basic structure.

In the next chapter, we will expand our sentence structure by introducing direct objects in the accusative case and learn about prepositions and adverbs. *Discere perseverāte*! (Continue to learn diligently!)
