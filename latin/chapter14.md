# Chapter 14: Relative Clauses and Result Clauses

Welcome to Chapter 14! In this chapter, we will continue our exploration of complex sentence structures by learning about relative clauses and result clauses. These clause types add descriptive detail and express consequences or outcomes in Latin sentences.

## 14.1 Relative Clauses (Clauses of Relation)

Relative clauses are subordinate clauses that modify a noun or pronoun in the main clause, called the **antecedent**. They provide additional information about the antecedent, often specifying *which* one or *what kind* of noun is being referred to. Relative clauses are introduced by **relative pronouns**, most commonly *quī, quae, quod* (who, which, that).

**Relative Pronoun: *quī, quae, quod***

The relative pronoun *quī, quae, quod* declines as follows:

| Case        | Masculine | Feminine | Neuter  |
| :---------- | :-------- | :------- | :------ |
| Nominative  | *quī*     | *quae*   | *quod*  |
| Genitive    | *cuius*   | *cuius*  | *cuius* |
| Dative      | *cui*     | *cui*    | *cui*   |
| Accusative  | *quem*    | *quam*   | *quod*  |
| Ablative    | *quō*     | *quā*    | *quō*   |
| Nominative Plural | *quī*     | *quae*   | *quae*  |
| Genitive Plural   | *quōrum*  | *quārum* | *quōrum*|
| Dative Plural     | *quibus*  | *quibus* | *quibus*|
| Accusative Plural | *quōs*    | *quās*   | *quae*  |
| Ablative Plural   | *quibus*  | *quibus* | *quibus*|

**Agreement of Relative Pronoun:**

The relative pronoun agrees with its **antecedent** in **gender** and **number**, but its **case** is determined by its **function within its own clause**.

**Structure of Relative Clauses:**

1.  **Antecedent:** Noun or pronoun in the main clause that the relative clause modifies.
2.  **Relative Pronoun:** *quī, quae, quod* (or other relative pronoun/adjective), agreeing with the antecedent in gender and number, but case determined by its role in the relative clause.
3.  **Verb in Relative Clause:** Usually in the indicative or subjunctive mood, depending on the type of relative clause.

**Types of Relative Clauses:**

*   **Descriptive Relative Clauses (Indicative):** Simply provide additional information about the antecedent. Verb is usually in the indicative mood.
    *   *Puella, **quae  legit**,  docta  est.* - The girl, **who is reading**, is learned.
        *   *Puella* - antecedent (feminine singular)
        *   *quae* - relative pronoun (feminine singular nominative - subject of *legit*)
        *   *legit* - verb in indicative mood

*   **Relative Clauses of Characteristic (Subjunctive):** Describe the *kind* of person or thing the antecedent is. Often used with indefinite or general antecedents. Verb is in the subjunctive mood.
    *   *Sunt  quī  hoc  **dicant***. - There are some **who might say** this.
        *   *quī* - relative pronoun (masculine plural nominative - subject of *dicant*)
        *   *dicant* - verb in subjunctive mood (present subjunctive)

**Examples of Relative Clauses (Descriptive - Indicative):**

1.  *Liber,  **quem  puella  portat**,  bellus  est.*
    *   *Liber* - antecedent (masculine singular)
    *   *quem* - relative pronoun (masculine singular accusative - direct object of *portat*)
    *   *puella portat* - the girl carries
    *   Translation: The book, **which the girl is carrying**, is beautiful.

2.  *Urbs,  **quae  antīqua  est**,  magna  est.*
    *   *Urbs* - antecedent (feminine singular)
    *   *quae* - relative pronoun (feminine singular nominative - subject of *est*)
    *   *antīqua est* - is ancient
    *   Translation: The city, **which is ancient**, is great.

3.  *Dominus,  **cui  servus  pāret**,  potēns  est.*
    *   *Dominus* - antecedent (masculine singular)
    *   *cui* - relative pronoun (masculine singular dative - indirect object of *pāret*)
    *   *servus pāret* - the slave obeys
    *   Translation: The lord, **whom the slave obeys**, is powerful. (*pāret* - present indicative of *pāreō, pāre
