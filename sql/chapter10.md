#### 10.3 Stage 1: Requirements Analysis and Conceptual Design

**10.3.1 Understanding the Requirements**

An online bookstore needs to manage information about:

- **Books:** Title, ISBN, publication year, price, description, category, etc.
- **Authors:** Author ID, name, biography.
- **Categories:** Category ID, category name.
- **Customers:** Customer ID, name, contact information, address, registration date.
- **Orders:** Order ID, order date, customer ID, shipping address, order status.
- **Order Items:** Items within each order, linking orders to books and quantities.

**10.3.2 Creating an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)**

Based on these requirements, you should create an ERD. Hereâ€™s a conceptual outline to get you started:

- **Entities:** `Books`, `Authors`, `Categories`, `Customers`, `Orders`, `OrderItems`.
- **Relationships:**
    - A Book is written by one or more Authors (Author-Book relationship - many-to-many).
    - A Book belongs to one Category (Category-Book relationship - one-to-many).
    - A Customer places many Orders (Customer-Order relationship - one-to-many).
    - An Order consists of many Order Items (Order-OrderItem relationship - one-to-many).
    - Each Order Item is for a specific Book (OrderItem-Book relationship - one-to-many).

**Exercise 10.3.1: Design an ERD for the Online Bookstore**

Draw an ERD that represents these entities and relationships. Include attributes for each entity and clearly indicate primary keys and foreign keys. Consider cardinality (one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many) for each relationship. Tools like draw.io or Lucidchart can be helpful for creating ERDs.

---

#### 10.4 Stage 2: Logical and Physical Database Design

**10.4.1 Translating ERD to Logical Schema**

Translate your ERD into a logical schema by defining tables and columns. For example:

- **Authors Table:** `AuthorID (PK), AuthorName, Biography`
- **Categories Table:** `CategoryID (PK), CategoryName`
- **Books Table:** `BookID (PK), ISBN, Title, PublicationYear, Price, Description, CategoryID (FK)`
- **Customers Table:** `CustomerID (PK), FirstName, LastName, Email, Address, RegistrationDate`
- **Orders Table:** `OrderID (PK), OrderDate, CustomerID (FK), ShippingAddress, OrderStatus`
- **AuthorBook Table (for many-to-many relationship between Authors and Books):** `AuthorID (FK), BookID (FK), PRIMARY KEY (AuthorID, BookID)`
- **OrderItems Table:** `OrderItemID (PK), OrderID (FK), BookID (FK), Quantity, Price`

**10.4.2 Choosing Data Types and Constraints**

Select appropriate data types for each column and define constraints (e.g., `NOT NULL`, `UNIQUE`, `PRIMARY KEY`, `FOREIGN KEY`). Consider data integrity and efficiency when making these choices.

**Exercise 10.4.1: Define DDL Statements to Create Tables**

Write DDL `CREATE TABLE` statements for each table in your schema. Include appropriate data types and constraints based on your design. For example:

```sql
CREATE TABLE Authors (
    AuthorID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    AuthorName VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    Biography TEXT
);

CREATE TABLE Categories (
    CategoryID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    CategoryName VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL
);

-- Continue creating tables for Books, Customers, Orders, AuthorBook, and OrderItems
```

#### 10.5 Stage 3: Database Implementation and Data Population

**10.5.1 Implementing the Database**

Choose a database system (e.g., SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL) and implement your schema by running the DDL statements you created. You can use a SQL client tool or command-line interface to interact with your database.

**10.5.2 Populating the Database with Sample Data**

Populate your tables with realistic sample data. Aim for a sufficient amount of data to test your queries effectively. Consider creating data for:

- At least 20-30 books across various categories.
- 10-15 authors.
- 5-7 categories.
- 20-30 customers.
- 50-100 orders with multiple order items each.

**Exercise 10.5.1: Write INSERT Statements to Populate Tables**

Write `INSERT` statements to populate each table with sample data. For example:

```sql
INSERT INTO Authors (AuthorID, AuthorName, Biography) VALUES
(1, 'Jane Austen', 'English novelist known primarily for her six major novels...'),
(2, 'Charles Dickens', 'English writer and social critic, regarded by many as the greatest novelist of the Victorian era...');

INSERT INTO Categories (CategoryID, CategoryName) VALUES
(1, 'Fiction'),
(2, 'Mystery'),
(3, 'Science Fiction');

-- Continue inserting data into Books, Customers, Orders, AuthorBook, and OrderItems tables
```

#### 10.6 Stage 4: Query Development - Real-World Scenarios

Develop SQL queries to address common bookstore operations and reporting needs. Here are some example scenarios:

**Scenario 1: Retrieve Book Details**
- Query to retrieve the title, ISBN, price, category name, and author names for a specific book given its title.

**Scenario 2: Customer Order History**
- Query to display all orders placed by a specific customer, including order date, order ID, and total amount for each order.

**Scenario 3: Sales Report by Category**
- Query to generate a sales report showing the total sales amount for each book category for a given period.

**Scenario 4: Top Selling Books**
- Query to find the top 5 best-selling books based on the quantity sold.

**Scenario 5: Search Books by Keyword**
- Implement a full-text search capability to find books whose titles or descriptions contain a given keyword.

**Exercise 10.6.1: Write SQL Queries for Each Scenario**

Write SQL queries to address each of the scenarios described above. Use appropriate `SELECT`, `JOIN`, `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`, and aggregate functions to retrieve the required data.

---

#### 10.7 Stage 5: Performance Optimization

**10.7.1 Analyze Query Performance**

Use `EXPLAIN PLAN` or similar tools to analyze the execution plan of your queries, especially for complex queries or those that retrieve large datasets. Identify potential performance bottlenecks, such as full table scans or inefficient joins.

**10.7.2 Apply Optimization Techniques**

Based on your analysis, apply optimization techniques:

- **Add Indexes:** Create indexes on columns frequently used in `WHERE` clauses, `JOIN` conditions, and `ORDER BY` clauses.
- **Rewrite Queries:** Refactor slow queries to use more efficient join types, reduce subqueries, or optimize `WHERE` clause conditions.
- **Optimize Data Types:** Ensure you are using the most efficient data types.

**Exercise 10.7.1: Optimize Queries for Performance**

Identify at least two queries from Stage 4 that could be optimized for performance. Analyze their execution plans, apply optimization techniques (like adding indexes), and measure the improvement in performance (if possible in your environment). Document the steps you took and the results.
