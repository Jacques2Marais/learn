# Chapter 19: Analysis and Modeling

Chapter 19 is dedicated to the core analysis and modeling phase of your capstone project. Building upon the data collection and exploration work from the previous chapter, you will now apply statistical analysis techniques or machine learning models to address your research question and extract meaningful insights from your dataset.

## Applying Statistical Analysis Techniques

If your capstone project involves statistical analysis, this chapter will guide you through applying appropriate statistical methods using Python and SciPy. The specific techniques will depend on your research question and the nature of your data.

**Common Statistical Analysis Techniques (revisit Chapter 8 and adapt):**

*   **Descriptive Statistics and Hypothesis Testing:**
    *   Calculate descriptive statistics (means, standard deviations, confidence intervals) for relevant variables using Pandas and NumPy.
    *   Perform hypothesis tests (t-tests, chi-squared tests, ANOVA, correlation tests) using SciPy `stats` to test specific hypotheses related to your research question.
*   **Regression Analysis:**
    *   If your project involves modeling relationships between variables, apply regression techniques (linear regression, polynomial regression, multiple regression) using SciPy `stats` or scikit-learn.
    *   Evaluate regression model fit using metrics like R-squared, MSE, RMSE, and p-values for coefficients.
*   **Time Series Analysis (if applicable):**
    *   If you are working with time series data, apply time series analysis techniques (decomposition, autocorrelation analysis, forecasting models like ARIMA) using Pandas and Statsmodels.

**Example: Statistical Analysis - Hypothesis Testing (Placeholder - Adapt to your project)**

Let's assume your capstone project involves comparing two groups based on some measurements in your dataset, and you want to perform an independent samples t-test.

```python
# Code cell
import pandas as pd
from scipy import stats

# Assume df_capstone is your cleaned DataFrame from previous chapter

# --- Example Hypothesis Testing (Independent Samples t-test - Adapt to your project!) ---

# Example: Compare 'measurement_column' between 'group_A' and 'group_B' categories in 'group_column'
measurement_column_name = 'measurement_column' # Replace with your actual measurement column
group_column_name = 'group_column' # Replace with your actual grouping column
group_A_name = 'Group A' # Replace with actual group A identifier
group_B_name = 'Group B' # Replace with actual group B identifier

if measurement_column_name in df_capstone.columns and group_column_name in df_capstone.columns:
    group_A_data = df_capstone[df_capstone[group_column_name] == group_A_name][measurement_column_name].dropna() # Extract data for Group A, drop NaNs
    group_B_data = df_capstone[df_capstone[group_column_name] == group_B_name][measurement_column_name].dropna() # Extract data for Group B, drop NaNs

    if not group_A_data.empty and not group_B_data.empty: # Check if both groups have data
        # Perform independent samples t-test
        t_statistic, p_value = stats.ttest_ind(group_A_data, group_B_data)

        print(f"Independent Samples t-test results for '{measurement_column_name}' between '{group_A_name}' and '{group_B_name}':")
        print("T-statistic:", t_statistic)
        print("P-value:", p_value)

        alpha = 0.05 # Significance level
        if p_value < alpha:
            print(f"Reject null hypothesis (p < {alpha}): Means are significantly different between '{group_A_name}' and '{group_B_name}'.")
        else:
            print(f"Fail to reject null hypothesis (p >= {alpha}): No significant difference in means detected between '{group_A_name}' and '{group_B_name}'.")
    else:
        print(f"Warning: Not enough data for groups '{group_A_name}' or '{group_B_name}' in '{group_column_name}' to perform t-test.")
else:
    print(f"Error: Measurement column '{measurement_column_name}' or group column '{group_column_name}' not found in DataFrame.")
```

Adapt this example to perform statistical tests relevant to your capstone project, replacing placeholder column names and group identifiers with your actual data.

## Applying Machine Learning Models

If your capstone project involves predictive modeling or pattern recognition, you will apply machine learning algorithms using scikit-learn. Choose appropriate models based on your research question and data characteristics (revisit Chapter 10 and Chapter 12).

**Common Machine Learning Tasks and Algorithms (adapt to your project):**

*   **Classification:** If you are predicting a categorical variable (e.g., classifying types of astronomical objects, predicting experimental outcomes categories):
    *   **Logistic Regression:** For linear classification, good baseline model.
    *   **Support Vector Machines (SVM):** For linear and non-linear classification, versatile and powerful.
    *   **Decision Trees or Random Forests:** For non-linear classification, interpretable (Decision Trees), robust and accurate (Random Forests).
    *   **Other classifiers:** Explore other classifiers in scikit-learn (e.g., k-Nearest Neighbors, Naive Bayes, Gradient Boosting).
*   **Regression:** If you are predicting a continuous variable (e.g., predicting exoplanet properties, modeling physical quantities):
    *   **Linear Regression:** For linear relationships, simple and interpretable.
    *   **Polynomial Regression:** For non-linear relationships that can be modeled with polynomials.
    *   **Decision Tree Regression or Random Forest Regression:** For non-linear regression, flexible and can capture complex relationships.
    *   **Support Vector Regression (SVR):** For robust regression, can handle non-linear relationships.
    *   **Other regressors:** Explore other regressors in scikit-learn (e.g., Gradient Boosting Regressors, Neural Networks - in later chapters or for more advanced projects).
*   **Clustering (if applicable for unsupervised learning project):**
    *   **k-means Clustering:** For partitioning data into clusters, simple and efficient.
    *   **Hierarchical Clustering:** For building a hierarchy of clusters, can capture different cluster shapes.
    *   **Other clustering algorithms:** Explore other clustering algorithms in scikit-learn (e.g., DBSCAN, AgglomerativeClustering).
*   **Dimensionality Reduction (if needed for visualization or feature extraction):**
    *   **PCA:** For linear dimensionality reduction and feature extraction.
    *   **t-SNE:** For non-linear dimensionality reduction and visualization of high-dimensional data.

**Example: Machine Learning Model - Classification with Logistic Regression (Placeholder - Adapt to your project)**

Let's assume your capstone project involves a classification task, and you choose to use Logistic Regression as a baseline model.

```python
# Code cell
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split, GridSearchCV
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report, confusion_matrix
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
import pandas as pd

# Assume df_capstone is your cleaned DataFrame, X (features), y (target variable) are prepared

# --- Example Machine Learning Workflow - Classification with Logistic Regression (Adapt to your project!) ---

# 1. Feature and Target Variable Selection (Adapt to your dataset - example features and target)
feature_cols = ['feature_1', 'feature_2', 'feature_3', 'feature_4'] # Replace with your actual feature column names
target_col = 'target_variable_classification' # Replace with your actual target column name

if all(col in df_capstone.columns for col in feature_cols) and target_col in df_capstone.columns:
    X = df_capstone[feature_cols] # Features DataFrame
    y = df_capstone[target_col] # Target Series

    # 2. Data Splitting (Train-Test Split)
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42, stratify=y) # Stratify for classification tasks, adjust test_size

    # 3. Feature Scaling (StandardScaler - important for Logistic Regression and SVM)
    scaler = StandardScaler()
    X_train_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X_train) # Fit on training data and transform
    X_test_scaled = scaler.transform(X_test) # Apply same transformation to test data

    # 4. Model Selection and Initialization (Logistic Regression)
    logreg_classifier_capstone = LogisticRegression(random_state=42, max_iter=1000) # Initialize classifier

    # 5. Hyperparameter Tuning (Optional - GridSearchCV example)
    param_grid_logreg = {'C': [0.1, 1, 10]} # Example hyperparameter grid for Logistic Regression
    grid_search_logreg = GridSearchCV(logreg_classifier_capstone, param_grid_logreg, cv=3, scoring='accuracy') # 3-fold CV, scoring=accuracy
    grid_search_logreg.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train) # Fit GridSearchCV on scaled training data
    best_logreg_model = grid_search_logreg.best_estimator_ # Get best model from grid search
    print("\nBest Logistic Regression Hyperparameters (GridSearchCV):", grid_search_logreg.best_params_)

    # 6. Train Best Model (or directly train initial model if no hyperparameter tuning)
    best_logreg_model.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train) # Train best model on scaled training data

    # 7. Make Predictions on Test Set
    y_pred_logreg_capstone = best_logreg_model.predict(X_test_scaled)

    # 8. Evaluate Model Performance (Classification Metrics)
    accuracy_logreg_capstone = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred_logreg_capstone)
    conf_matrix_logreg_capstone = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred_logreg_capstone)
    class_report_logreg_capstone = classification_report(y_test, y_pred_logreg_capstone)

    print("\n--- Logistic Regression Model Evaluation ---")
    print("Test Set Accuracy:", accuracy_logreg_capstone)
    print("\nConfusion Matrix:\n", conf_matrix_logreg_capstone)
    print("\nClassification Report:\n", class_report_logreg_capstone)

else:
    print("Error: Feature columns or target column not found in DataFrame. Adapt column names to your dataset.")
```

Adapt this example to implement machine learning models relevant to your capstone project. Remember to:

*   **Choose appropriate features and target variables from your dataset.**
*   **Split data into training and testing sets.**
*   **Preprocess features (scaling, encoding, etc.).**
*   **Select and initialize a suitable model (classifier or regressor).**
*   **Perform hyperparameter tuning (optional but recommended) using GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV.**
*   **Train your model on the training data.**
*   **Evaluate model performance on the test set using appropriate metrics.**

## Model Evaluation and Refinement

Model evaluation is crucial to assess the performance of your chosen statistical analysis or machine learning models. Use the evaluation metrics discussed in Chapter 11 (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, AUC-ROC for classification; MSE, RMSE, MAE, R-squared for regression).

**Model Refinement:**

Based on your evaluation results, you may need to refine your model or analysis approach. This could involve:

*   **Feature engineering:** Creating new features or transforming existing ones to improve model performance.
*   **Model selection:** Trying different models or algorithms to see if they perform better.
*   **Hyperparameter tuning:** Optimizing hyperparameters of your chosen model using GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV.
*   **Addressing overfitting or underfitting:** Adjusting model complexity, regularization, or data augmentation techniques to improve generalization.
*   **Error analysis:** Examining misclassified instances or prediction errors to understand model limitations and potential areas for improvement.

Iterate through model building, evaluation, and refinement until you achieve satisfactory results or reach the limitations of your dataset and chosen techniques.

## Generating Results and Insights

The final goal of the analysis and modeling phase is to generate meaningful results and insights that address your research question. This involves:

*   **Interpreting model results:** Understand what your statistical analysis or machine learning model is telling you about your data and the problem you are addressing.
*   **Quantifying uncertainties and statistical significance:** If applicable, report confidence intervals, p-values, or other measures of uncertainty and statistical significance.
*   **Visualizing results:** Create clear and informative visualizations (plots, charts, tables) to present your findings effectively (as discussed in Chapter 15).
*   **Drawing conclusions:** Based on your analysis and results, draw conclusions that answer your research question or address the problem you defined in your capstone project proposal.

Document your analysis and modeling process, evaluation results, and key insights in detail in your project report (Chapter 20).

This chapter guides you through the core analysis and modeling phase of your capstone project. In the next and final chapter, Chapter 20, you will focus on project presentation and report writing to communicate your project and findings effectively.
