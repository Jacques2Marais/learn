## Setting up Your Python Environment

To get started with Python for data science, we recommend using Anaconda. Anaconda is a free and open-source distribution of Python that simplifies package management and deployment. It comes pre-installed with many of the essential data science libraries we'll be using, making setup a breeze.

**Steps to install Anaconda:**

1.  **Download Anaconda:** Go to the Anaconda website ([https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution)) and download the Python 3.x version for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).

2.  **Install Anaconda:** Run the downloaded installer and follow the on-screen instructions.  It's generally recommended to accept the default settings during installation.

3.  **Verify Installation:** Once installed, open your terminal (or Anaconda Prompt on Windows) and type `conda --version`. If Anaconda is installed correctly, you should see the conda version number.

**Jupyter Notebooks:**

Anaconda comes with Jupyter Notebook, an interactive computing environment that's perfect for data science and learning. Jupyter Notebooks allow you to write and execute Python code, display visualizations, and add explanatory text all in one document. We will be using Jupyter Notebooks extensively throughout this course.

**To launch Jupyter Notebook:**

1.  Open your terminal (or Anaconda Prompt).
2.  Type `jupyter notebook` and press Enter.

This will open Jupyter Notebook in your web browser. You can then create new notebooks, open existing ones, and start writing Python code.

## Introduction to Jupyter Notebooks and Markdown

Jupyter Notebooks are composed of cells. The two main cell types you'll use are:

*   **Code cells:**  Where you write and execute Python code.
*   **Markdown cells:** Where you write formatted text using Markdown syntax to explain your code, add headings, create lists, and more.

**Basic Jupyter Notebook Operations:**

*   **Creating a new notebook:** In the Jupyter Notebook interface, click on "New" (usually on the top right) and select "Python 3" (or the Python version you installed).
*   **Adding cells:**  Click the "+" button in the toolbar to add a new cell below the currently selected cell.
*   **Changing cell type:** Use the dropdown menu in the toolbar to change a cell from "Code" to "Markdown" or vice versa.
*   **Executing code cells:** Select a code cell and press `Shift + Enter` to run the code in the cell and move to the next cell. Press `Ctrl + Enter` (or `Cmd + Enter` on macOS) to run the code and stay in the current cell.
*   **Markdown syntax:** Markdown is a lightweight markup language that's easy to learn. Here are a few basic Markdown elements:

    *   **Headings:** Use `#` for headings. `# Heading 1`, `## Heading 2`, `### Heading 3`, etc.
    *   **Bold:** `**bold text**` or `__bold text__`
    *   *Italics:* `*italicized text*` or `_italicized text_`
    *   **Lists:**
        *   Unordered lists: use `*`, `-`, or `+` followed by a space.
            ```markdown
            * Item 1
            * Item 2
            ```
        *   Ordered lists: use numbers followed by a period and a space.
            ```markdown
            1. First item
            2. Second item
            ```
    *   **Links:** `[Link text](URL)` e.g., `[Anaconda website](https://www.anaconda.com)`
    *   **Images:** `![Image alt text](image-URL.jpg)`
    *   **Code blocks:** Use backticks `` `code` `` for inline code or triple backticks ``` ``` for multiline code blocks.

*   **Saving notebooks:** Jupyter Notebooks are automatically saved periodically. You can also manually save by clicking the save icon in the toolbar or using `File > Save`.
*   **Renaming notebooks:**  Click on the notebook title at the top of the page to rename it.

## Basic Python Syntax: Variables, Data Types, Operators

Let's dive into the fundamental building blocks of Python syntax.

**Variables:**

In Python, you don't need to declare the type of a variable explicitly. You simply assign a value to a variable name, and Python infers the type automatically.

```python
# Code cell
x = 10          # x is an integer
y = 3.14        # y is a float (floating-point number)
name = "Alice"  # name is a string (text)
is_student = True # is_student is a boolean (True or False)

print(x)
print(y)
print(name)
print(is_student)
```

**Data Types:**

Python has several built-in data types. The most common ones you'll encounter in data science are:

*   **Integers (`int`):** Whole numbers (e.g., `-3`, `0`, `100`).
*   **Floats (`float`):**  Numbers with decimal points (e.g., `-2.5`, `3.14159`).
*   **Strings (`str`):** Textual data enclosed in single quotes (`'`) or double quotes (`"`). (e.g., `'hello'`, `"Python"`).
*   **Booleans (`bool`):**  Logical values, either `True` or `False`.
*   **Lists (`list`):** Ordered, mutable sequences of items, enclosed in square brackets `[]`. (e.g., `[1, 2, 3]`, `['a', 'b', 'c']`).
*   **Tuples (`tuple`):** Ordered, immutable sequences of items, enclosed in parentheses `()`. (e.g., `(1, 2, 3)`, `('x', 'y', 'z')`).
*   **Dictionaries (`dict`):**  Unordered collections of key-value pairs, enclosed in curly braces `{}`. (e.g., `{'name': 'Bob', 'age': 25}`).
*   **Sets (`set`):** Unordered collections of unique items, enclosed in curly braces `{}`. (e.g., `{1, 2, 3}`, `{'apple', 'banana', 'orange'}`).

You can check the data type of a variable using the `type()` function:

```python
print(type(x))
print(type(name))
```

**Operators:**

Python supports various operators for performing operations on variables and values. Here are some essential operators:

*   **Arithmetic Operators:**
    *   `+` (addition)
    *   `-` (subtraction)
    *   `*` (multiplication)
    *   `/` (division)
    *   `//` (floor division - integer division)
    *   `%` (modulo - remainder)
    *   `**` (exponentiation - power)

```python
a = 20
b = 7

print(a + b)     # Addition
print(a - b)     # Subtraction
print(a * b)     # Multiplication
print(a / b)     # Division
print(a // b)    # Floor Division
print(a % b)     # Modulo
print(a ** 2)    # Exponentiation
```

*   **Comparison Operators:**
    *   `==` (equal to)
    *   `!=` (not equal to)
    *   `>`  (greater than)
    *   `<`  (less than)
    *   `>=` (greater than or equal to)
    *   `<=` (less than or equal to)

Comparison operators return boolean values (`True` or `False`).

```python
p = 15
q = 15

print(p == q)  # Equal to
print(p != q)  # Not equal to
print(p > 10)  # Greater than
print(p < 20)  # Less than
```

*   **Assignment Operators:**
    *   `=`  (assignment)
    *   `+=` (add and assign)
    *   `-=` (subtract and assign)
    *   `*=` (multiply and assign)
    *   `/=` (divide and assign)
    *   `%=` (modulo and assign)
    *   `**=` (exponentiate and assign)

```python
count = 0
count += 1     # Equivalent to count = count + 1
print(count)

price = 100
price *= 0.9   # Equivalent to price = price * 0.9 (10% discount)
print(price)
```

*   **Logical Operators:**
    *   `and` (logical AND)
    *   `or`  (logical OR)
    *   `not` (logical NOT)

Logical operators are used to combine or modify boolean expressions.

```python
is_raining = True
is_sunny = False

print(is_raining and is_sunny)   # Logical AND (both must be True)
print(is_raining or is_sunny)    # Logical OR (at least one must be True)
print(not is_raining)         # Logical NOT (inverts the boolean value)
```

## Your First Python Program: "Hello, Data Science!"

It's tradition to start with a "Hello, World!" program when learning a new language. In our data science context, let's make it "Hello, Data Science!".

Open a new Jupyter Notebook, create a code cell, and type the following code:

```python
# Code cell
print("Hello, Data Science!")
```

Press `Shift + Enter` to execute the cell. You should see the output:

```
Hello, Data Science!
```

Congratulations! You've written and run your first Python program for data science.
