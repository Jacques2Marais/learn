# Chapter 6: Monopoly

## 6.1 Sources of Monopoly Power: Why Monopolies Arise

**Monopoly** is a market structure where there is a single seller who controls the supply of a particular good or service.  A **monopolist** is the sole producer in the market.  Unlike firms in perfect competition that are price takers, a monopolist is a **price maker** – it has the power to influence the market price by changing the quantity it supplies.

Monopolies arise due to **barriers to entry**, which prevent new firms from entering the market and competing with the existing monopolist.  The main sources of barriers to entry are:

1.  **Monopoly Resources:** A single firm owns a key resource necessary for production.
    *   Example: De Beers historically controlled a large percentage of the world's diamond mines, giving them near-monopoly power in the diamond market.
    *   In practice, pure resource monopolies are rare because most resources are widely distributed.

2.  **Government-Created Monopolies:** The government grants a single firm the exclusive right to produce a good or service.
    *   **Patents and Copyrights:**  Governments grant patents to inventors and copyrights to authors and artists to encourage innovation and creative work. These create temporary monopolies.
    *   **Franchises and Licenses:**  In some industries, the government may grant a franchise or license to a single firm to operate, such as in utilities (e.g., electricity, water) or broadcasting.

3.  **Natural Monopolies:** A single firm can supply a good or service to an entire market at a lower cost than two or more firms could.  Natural monopolies typically arise in industries with high fixed costs and low marginal costs, where there are significant economies of scale over the relevant range of output.
    *   Examples:  Distribution of water, natural gas, and electricity.  Setting up a network of pipes or wires is very costly (high fixed cost), but once the network is in place, the cost of supplying additional units (marginal cost) is relatively low.  If multiple firms were to build competing networks, the average cost of supply would be much higher.

4.  **Network Externalities:** The value of a product or service increases as more people use it.  This can lead to a "winner-take-all" market where the firm that establishes a large network early on gains a significant advantage and can become a monopoly.
    *   Examples: Social media platforms, operating systems, online marketplaces.

5.  **Aggressive Tactics and Predatory Pricing:**  In some cases, a firm may become a monopoly by engaging in aggressive business tactics, such as predatory pricing (temporarily setting prices very low to drive out competitors).  However, predatory pricing is often difficult to sustain and may be illegal.

The existence of barriers to entry is crucial for maintaining monopoly power. Without barriers to entry, economic profits earned by a monopolist would attract new firms to enter the market, increasing competition and eroding the monopolist's market power, eventually leading to a more competitive market structure.

## 6.2 Demand and Marginal Revenue for a Monopolist: Price Maker

Unlike a perfectly competitive firm that faces a horizontal demand curve, a monopolist faces the **market demand curve**.  This market demand curve is typically downward sloping.  This is a crucial difference and has significant implications for the monopolist's pricing and output decisions.

**(Imagine a graph showing a downward-sloping market demand curve faced by a monopolist.)**

*   **Downward-Sloping Demand Curve:**  The monopolist's demand curve is the market demand curve, which is downward sloping.  To sell a larger quantity, the monopolist must lower its price.
*   **Price Maker:** The monopolist has the power to choose its price, but it is constrained by the demand curve.  It cannot choose both price and quantity independently.  If it sets a higher price, it will sell a smaller quantity, and if it wants to sell a larger quantity, it must lower its price.

**Marginal Revenue (MR) for a Monopolist:**

For a monopolist, marginal revenue is always **less than** the price (MR < P), except for the very first unit sold.  This is because when a monopolist wants to sell one more unit, it must lower the price not only for that additional unit but also for all the previous units it was already selling.  This price reduction on all previous units reduces the marginal revenue from selling one more unit.

Let's illustrate this with an example. Suppose a monopolist faces the following demand schedule:

| Quantity (Q) | Price (P) | Total Revenue (TR = P*Q) | Marginal Revenue (MR = ΔTR/ΔQ) |
|--------------|-----------|--------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| 0            | $11       | $0                       | -                                 |
| 1            | $10       | $10                      | $10                               |
| 2            | $9        | $18                      | $8                                |
| 3            | $8        | $24                      | $6                                |
| 4            | $7        | $28                      | $4                                |
| 5            | $6        | $30                      | $2                                |
| 6            | $5        | $30                      | $0                                |
| 7            | $4        | $28                      | -$2                               |

Notice that marginal revenue is always less than price after the first unit.  For example, to sell the 2nd unit, the monopolist must lower the price from $10 to $9.  The marginal revenue from selling the 2nd unit is $8, which is less than the price of $9.  This is because the monopolist gains $9 from selling the 2nd unit, but it loses $1 from selling the first unit at $9 instead of $10 (price reduction on the first unit).

**(Imagine a graph showing the demand curve and marginal revenue curve for a monopolist.  The MR curve lies below the demand curve and is steeper.  For a linear demand curve, the MR curve has the same vertical intercept but twice the slope.)**

*   **MR Curve Below Demand Curve:** The marginal revenue curve lies below the demand curve for a monopolist.
*   **MR Curve Steeper than Demand Curve:** For a linear demand curve, the MR curve is twice as steep as the demand curve.
*   **MR Can Be Negative:** Marginal revenue can become negative when demand is inelastic.  This happens when lowering the price to sell more units leads to a decrease in total revenue.

## 6.3 Profit Maximization for a Monopolist: MR = MC

Like all firms, a monopolist maximizes profit by producing at the output level where marginal revenue (MR) equals marginal cost (MC).  However, for a monopolist, MR is not equal to price (MR < P).

**Profit Maximization Rule for a Monopolist: Produce where MR = MC**

1.  **Find the output level where MR = MC:**  This is the profit-maximizing quantity (Q_m).
2.  **Determine the price from the demand curve:**  Once the monopolist has chosen the profit-maximizing quantity Q_m, it will set the price (P_m) at the highest level that consumers are willing to pay for that quantity, which is found on the demand curve at quantity Q_m.

**(Imagine a graph showing profit maximization for a monopolist.  Show the demand curve, MR curve, MC curve, and ATC curve.  The profit-maximizing quantity Q_m is where MR = MC.  The price P_m is found on the demand curve at Q_m.  Illustrate the profit area.)**

**Steps to Find Profit-Maximizing Output and Price:**

1.  **Derive the MR curve from the demand curve.**
2.  **Find the intersection of the MR curve and the MC curve.**  This gives the profit-maximizing quantity Q_m.
3.  **Find the price P_m on the demand curve corresponding to Q_m.**
4.  **Calculate profit:** Profit = (P_m - ATC(Q_m)) * Q_m.

## 6.4 Monopoly Output and Price Decisions: Lower Output, Higher Price

Compared to perfect competition, a monopolist produces a **lower quantity** and charges a **higher price**.  This is a key result and a major source of inefficiency associated with monopoly.

In perfect competition, firms produce where P = MC, and in long-run equilibrium, P = Minimum ATC.  In monopoly:

*   **Monopoly Output (Q_m) < Competitive Output (Q_c):**  The monopolist restricts output to keep the price higher.
*   **Monopoly Price (P_m) > Competitive Price (P_c):** The monopolist charges a price above marginal cost and average total cost.

This difference arises because a monopolist faces a downward-sloping demand curve and considers the trade-off between price and quantity when making output decisions.  It restricts output to keep the price high and maximize profit, while a perfectly competitive firm is a price taker and produces where P = MC.

## 6.5 Inefficiency of Monopoly: Deadweight Loss

Monopoly is inefficient because it leads to a **deadweight loss**, which represents a reduction in total welfare (consumer surplus + producer surplus) compared to the efficient outcome in perfect competition.

**(Imagine a graph showing the deadweight loss of monopoly.  Show the demand curve, MR curve, MC curve.  Identify the monopoly equilibrium (Q_m, P_m) and the competitive equilibrium (Q_c, P_c) where demand intersects MC.  The deadweight loss is the triangle area between the demand curve and MC curve, and between Q_m and Q_c.)**

*   **Deadweight Loss:** The deadweight loss of monopoly is the triangle area representing the lost consumer and producer surplus due to the monopolist producing less than the socially efficient output level.
*   **Underproduction:** Monopoly leads to underproduction compared to the socially efficient level.  The monopolist produces less than the quantity where marginal benefit (demand curve) equals marginal cost (MC curve).
*   **Price Above Marginal Cost:**  Monopoly price is higher than marginal cost (P_m > MC), violating the allocative efficiency condition (P = MC) that is achieved in perfect competition.  Consumers are willing to pay more than the marginal cost of production for additional units, but the monopolist restricts output to keep the price high.

**Welfare Effects of Monopoly:**

*   **Consumers are worse off:** Consumers pay a higher price and consume a smaller quantity compared to perfect competition, resulting in lower consumer surplus.
*   **Producers (Monopolist) are better off:** The monopolist earns economic profits, resulting in higher producer surplus compared to perfect competition (where producer surplus is zero in long-run equilibrium).
*   **Society as a whole is worse off:** The deadweight loss represents a net loss of total welfare to society.  The gains to the monopolist (increased producer surplus) are less than the losses to consumers (decreased consumer surplus + deadweight loss).

## 6.6 Price Discrimination: Charging Different Prices

**Price discrimination** is the practice of selling the same good or service to different customers at different prices, even though the costs of production are the same.  Price discrimination is possible only for firms with market power (like monopolists or firms in imperfect competition) and when certain conditions are met.

**Conditions for Price Discrimination:**

1.  **Market Power:** The firm must have some market power to be able to set prices (i.e., it must be a price maker).
2.  **Customer Segmentation:** The firm must be able to segment its customers into different groups with different willingness to pay (different demand elasticities).
3.  **No Resale:** The firm must be able to prevent resale of the product from customers who pay a low price to those who would pay a high price (arbitrage).

**Types of Price Discrimination:**

1.  **Perfect Price Discrimination (First-Degree Price Discrimination):** The monopolist charges each customer exactly their maximum willingness to pay.  In this case, the monopolist captures all consumer surplus and there is no deadweight loss.  However, perfect price discrimination is rarely possible in practice because firms usually do not know each customer's exact willingness to pay.
    *   Example:  A car salesperson negotiating individually with each customer and extracting the maximum price each customer is willing to pay.

2.  **Quantity Discrimination (Second-Degree Price Discrimination):** The monopolist charges different prices based on the quantity consumed.  Prices may decline as quantity consumed increases (volume discounts).
    *   Examples:  Bulk discounts, tiered pricing for electricity or water.

3.  **Multi-Market Price Discrimination (Third-Degree Price Discrimination):** The monopolist divides its customers into different groups (markets) and charges different prices to each group based on their demand elasticities.  Typically, groups with more inelastic demand are charged higher prices, and groups with more elastic demand are charged lower prices.
    *   Examples:  Student discounts, senior discounts, airline tickets (business vs. leisure travelers), movie tickets (matinee vs. evening shows), geographical price differences.

**Welfare Effects of Price Discrimination:**

*   **Perfect Price Discrimination:**  Can eliminate deadweight loss and achieve allocative efficiency (output level is the same as in perfect competition), but all consumer surplus is captured by the monopolist.  Total welfare may increase, but consumer welfare decreases.
*   **Other Forms of Price Discrimination:**  The welfare effects are ambiguous and depend on the specific circumstances.  Price discrimination can sometimes increase output and reduce deadweight loss compared to single-price monopoly, but it can also redistribute surplus from consumers to producers.

## 6.7 Government Regulation of Monopoly: Antitrust Policy and Natural Monopolies

Because monopolies can lead to inefficiencies and reduced consumer welfare, governments often intervene to regulate monopolies or promote competition.  The main policy tools are:

1.  **Antitrust Policy (Competition Policy):** Laws and regulations designed to prevent monopolies, promote competition, and prohibit anti-competitive practices (e.g., price fixing, mergers that reduce competition).
    *   **Breaking up monopolies:**  In some cases, governments may break up existing monopolies into smaller, competing firms (e.g., breakup of AT&T in the US).
    *   **Preventing mergers:**  Antitrust authorities review proposed mergers to ensure they do not substantially reduce competition.
    *   **Prohibiting anti-competitive practices:**  Laws prohibit practices like price fixing, collusion, and predatory pricing.

2.  **Regulation of Natural Monopolies:** For natural monopolies, breaking them up may not be efficient because a single firm can produce at a lower cost.  In these cases, governments often regulate natural monopolies instead of breaking them up.
    *   **Price regulation:**  Government agencies may set price ceilings for natural monopolies to prevent them from charging monopoly prices.
        *   **Average Cost Pricing:**  Setting price equal to average total cost (P = ATC).  This allows the firm to cover its costs and earn a normal profit, but it does not achieve allocative efficiency (P > MC).
        *   **Marginal Cost Pricing:** Setting price equal to marginal cost (P = MC).  This achieves allocative efficiency, but it may lead to losses for the firm if ATC > MC at the efficient output level (which is common for natural monopolies with high fixed costs).  Government subsidies may be needed to cover the firm's losses under marginal cost pricing.
    *   **Rate-of-return regulation:**  Allowing the firm to earn a "fair" rate of return on its investment.  This can be difficult to implement in practice and may lead to regulatory capture (the regulated firm influencing the regulator to act in its favor).

3.  **Public Ownership:** In some cases, the government may take over ownership and operation of a natural monopoly (nationalization).
    *   Examples:  Postal services, some utilities in some countries.
    *   Public ownership can address monopoly pricing concerns, but it may also lead to inefficiencies due to lack of profit incentives and bureaucratic management.

4.  **Doing Nothing:** In some cases, the government may choose to do nothing and allow the monopoly to exist unregulated, especially if the monopoly is temporary or if the costs of regulation are perceived to be higher than the benefits.

The choice of regulatory policy depends on the specific industry, the nature of the monopoly, and the trade-offs between efficiency, equity, and administrative feasibility.
