# Chapter 8: Oligopoly

## 8.1 Characteristics of Oligopoly: Competition Among the Few

**Oligopoly** is a market structure in which only a **few sellers** offer similar or identical products.  "Oligos" means "few" in Greek.  Oligopoly is a common market structure in many industries.  When a market is oligopolistic, the actions of one seller can significantly impact the profits of all other sellers.  Oligopolistic firms are **interdependent**.

The key characteristics of oligopoly are:

1.  **Few Sellers:**  Only a few firms dominate the market.  The number of sellers is small enough that each firm is aware of and affected by the actions of other firms.  Examples include industries with 2-10 major firms.

2.  **Homogeneous or Differentiated Products:** Oligopolies can sell either homogeneous products (like in the steel or oil industries) or differentiated products (like in the automobile or soft drink industries).
    *   **Homogeneous Oligopoly:** Firms sell identical or very similar products (e.g., crude oil, cement).  Competition is primarily based on price.
    *   **Differentiated Oligopoly:** Firms sell differentiated products (e.g., cars, smartphones, breakfast cereals).  Firms compete on price, product features, advertising, and branding.

3.  **Barriers to Entry:**  Significant barriers to entry prevent new firms from easily entering the market and competing with existing oligopolists.  Barriers to entry in oligopoly are similar to those in monopoly, and can include:
    *   **Economies of Scale:**  Large firms may have lower average costs, making it difficult for new small firms to enter and compete.
    *   **High Start-up Costs:**  Industries like aircraft manufacturing or oil refining require huge initial investments, deterring new entrants.
    *   **Patents and Technology:**  Existing firms may have patents or proprietary technology that new firms cannot easily access.
    *   **Brand Reputation and Customer Loyalty:**  Established brands may have strong customer loyalty, making it difficult for new firms to attract customers.
    *   **Strategic Barriers:**  Existing firms may take strategic actions to deter entry, such as predatory pricing, excess capacity, or product proliferation.
    *   **Government Licenses and Regulations:**  In some industries, government regulations or licenses may limit the number of firms that can operate.

4.  **Interdependence:**  Firms in an oligopoly are interdependent.  Each firm must consider the likely reactions of its rivals when making decisions about price, output, advertising, and product development.  Strategic interaction is a key feature of oligopoly.

Examples of oligopolistic industries include:

*   Automobile industry
*   Oil and gas industry
*   Airline industry
*   Telecommunications industry
*   Pharmaceutical industry
*   Breakfast cereal industry

## 8.2 Game Theory and Strategic Behavior: Thinking Ahead

Because firms in oligopoly are interdependent, their behavior is **strategic**.  **Strategic behavior** refers to actions that a firm takes, taking into account the expected reactions of its rivals.  To analyze strategic behavior in oligopoly, economists use **game theory**.

**Game Theory** is the study of how people behave in strategic situations.  A "game" in game theory is a situation in which players (firms) must make strategic decisions, and the outcome of the game (profits) depends on the actions of all players.

Key elements of a game:

*   **Players:** The decision-makers (firms in oligopoly).
*   **Strategies:** The possible actions that each player can take (e.g., set a high price or a low price, produce a high quantity or a low quantity, advertise or not advertise).
*   **Payoffs:** The outcomes or rewards for each player, depending on the strategies chosen by all players (e.g., profits for firms).
*   **Rules:** The rules of the game specify the timing of moves and the information available to players.

**Types of Games:**

*   **Cooperative vs. Non-cooperative Games:**
    *   **Cooperative games:** Players can form binding agreements and coordinate their strategies (e.g., cartels).
    *   **Non-cooperative games:** Players cannot form binding agreements and act independently, taking into account the likely reactions of rivals (more common in oligopoly analysis).

*   **One-shot vs. Repeated Games:**
    *   **One-shot games:** The game is played only once.
    *   **Repeated games:** The game is played multiple times.  Repeated interaction can affect strategic behavior and the possibility of cooperation.

*   **Simultaneous vs. Sequential Games:**
    *   **Simultaneous games:** Players make their decisions at the same time, without knowing the other players' choices.
    *   **Sequential games:** Players make their decisions in sequence, with later players observing the actions of earlier players.

## 8.3 The Prisoner's Dilemma: A Classic Game of Conflict and Cooperation

The **Prisoner's Dilemma** is a classic example in game theory that illustrates the difficulties of cooperation even when it is mutually beneficial.  It is a two-player, simultaneous, non-cooperative game.

**The Scenario:**

Two suspects, Bonnie and Clyde, are arrested for a crime.  The police lack enough evidence for a conviction on the major charge, but they can convict both on a minor charge.  The police put Bonnie and Clyde in separate rooms and offer each the following deal:

*   **Confess (Betray):** If you confess and your partner does not confess, you go free, and your partner gets 10 years in prison.
*   **Remain Silent (Cooperate):** If you remain silent and your partner also remains silent, both of you get 1 year in prison on the minor charge.
*   **If both confess:** Both of you get 5 years in prison.

The **payoff matrix** for the Prisoner's Dilemma is:

|             | Clyde Confesses (Betray) | Clyde Remains Silent (Cooperate) |
|-------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Bonnie Confesses (Betray)    | Bonnie: 5 years, Clyde: 5 years | Bonnie: 0 years, Clyde: 10 years |
| Bonnie Remains Silent (Cooperate) | Bonnie: 10 years, Clyde: 0 years| Bonnie: 1 year, Clyde: 1 year  |

**Dominant Strategy:**

For each player, confessing is a **dominant strategy**.  A **dominant strategy** is a strategy that is best for a player regardless of what the other player does.

*   **For Bonnie:**
    *   If Clyde confesses, Bonnie is better off confessing (5 years vs. 10 years).
    *   If Clyde remains silent, Bonnie is better off confessing (0 years vs. 1 year).
    *   Confessing is Bonnie's dominant strategy.

*   **For Clyde:**
    *   If Bonnie confesses, Clyde is better off confessing (5 years vs. 10 years).
    *   If Bonnie remains silent, Clyde is better off confessing (0 years vs. 1 year).
    *   Confessing is Clyde's dominant strategy.

**Nash Equilibrium:**

The **Nash equilibrium** is an outcome in which each player is doing the best they can, given the actions of the other players.  In the Prisoner's Dilemma, the Nash equilibrium is **(Confess, Confess)**, where both Bonnie and Clyde confess and get 5 years in prison.

**The Dilemma:**

The dilemma is that both Bonnie and Clyde would be better off if they both remained silent (1 year each), but they are both individually incentivized to confess, leading to a worse outcome for both of them.  The individually rational choice (confess) leads to a collectively irrational outcome (both get 5 years instead of 1 year).

**Relevance to Oligopoly:**

The Prisoner's Dilemma provides insights into the behavior of oligopolistic firms.  In an oligopoly, firms may face a similar dilemma when deciding whether to compete aggressively or cooperate with rivals.

*   **Cooperation (Collusion):** Oligopolists could be better off if they cooperate and act like a monopolist, restricting output and raising prices to earn higher profits.  This is like Bonnie and Clyde remaining silent.
*   **Competition (Non-cooperation):** However, each firm has an incentive to cheat on the collusive agreement and compete aggressively (e.g., by lowering prices or increasing output) to gain a larger market share and higher profits at the expense of rivals.  This is like Bonnie and Clyde confessing.

Just like in the Prisoner's Dilemma, the individually rational choice for each firm (compete) may lead to a collectively worse outcome for all firms (lower profits) compared to cooperation (collusion).

## 8.4 Oligopoly Models: Cournot, Bertrand, and Stackelberg

Economists have developed various models to analyze oligopoly behavior, each making different assumptions about how firms interact and compete.  Three important models are:

### 8.4.1 Cournot Model: Quantity Competition

The **Cournot model** is a model of **quantity competition** in which firms simultaneously choose their output levels, and the market price is determined by the total quantity supplied.  It is a simultaneous game.

**Assumptions of the Cournot Model:**

*   **Few firms:**  Typically two firms (duopoly) for simplicity, but can be extended to more firms.
*   **Homogeneous products:** Firms sell identical products.
*   **Firms compete by choosing quantities:** Each firm decides how much to produce, taking into account the expected output of its rival.
*   **Simultaneous decisions:** Firms make their output decisions at the same time, without knowing the other firm's choice.
*   **Market price determined by total quantity:** The market price is determined by the total quantity supplied by all firms and the market demand curve.
*   **Firms maximize profit:** Each firm aims to maximize its profit, given its expectations about the output of its rival.

**Cournot Equilibrium:**

In the Cournot equilibrium, each firm chooses its output level to maximize its profit, given the output level chosen by its rival.  This is a Nash equilibrium in quantities.  To find the Cournot equilibrium, we need to find each firm's **reaction function**.  A **reaction function** shows a firm's best response (profit-maximizing output level) to any given output level chosen by its rival.

**(Imagine a graph showing Cournot reaction functions for two firms.  The intersection of the reaction functions is the Cournot equilibrium.)**

*   **Reaction Function:** For each firm, the reaction function is derived by maximizing its profit, taking the output of the other firm as given.
*   **Cournot Equilibrium:** The Cournot equilibrium is the intersection of the reaction functions, where each firm is producing its best response to the other firm's output, and neither firm has an incentive to change its output level unilaterally.

**Outcome of Cournot Competition:**

*   **Output:** Total output in Cournot oligopoly is greater than in monopoly but less than in perfect competition.
*   **Price:** Price in Cournot oligopoly is lower than in monopoly but higher than in perfect competition.
*   **Profit:** Firms earn economic profits, but less than a monopolist would earn.  Profits decrease as the number of firms increases.  As the number of firms approaches infinity, the Cournot outcome approaches the perfectly competitive outcome (price approaches marginal cost, and profits approach zero).

### 8.4.2 Bertrand Model: Price Competition

The **Bertrand model** is a model of **price competition** in which firms simultaneously choose their prices, and the market quantity demanded is determined by the prices set by all firms.  It is also a simultaneous game.

**Assumptions of the Bertrand Model:**

*   **Few firms:** Typically two firms (duopoly).
*   **Homogeneous products:** Firms sell identical products.
*   **Firms compete by choosing prices:** Each firm decides what price to charge, taking into account the expected price of its rival.
*   **Simultaneous decisions:** Firms make their price decisions at the same time, without knowing the other firm's choice.
*   **Consumers buy from the firm with the lowest price:** Consumers will buy from the firm offering the lowest price.  If prices are equal, consumers are indifferent and may split their purchases.
*   **Firms maximize profit:** Each firm aims to maximize its profit, given its expectations about the price of its rival.

**Bertrand Equilibrium:**

In the Bertrand equilibrium, each firm chooses its price to maximize its profit, given the price chosen by its rival.  This is a Nash equilibrium in prices.

**Bertrand Paradox:**

The Bertrand model leads to a surprising result known as the **Bertrand paradox**.  In the Bertrand equilibrium with homogeneous products and at least two firms, the price is driven down to marginal cost, and firms earn zero economic profits, just like in perfect competition!

*   **Price War:** If firms set prices above marginal cost, there is an incentive for each firm to undercut its rival slightly to capture the entire market demand.  This leads to a price war, with firms 계속 lowering prices.
*   **Equilibrium Price = Marginal Cost:** The price war continues until price is driven down to marginal cost.  At price = marginal cost, neither firm can profitably undercut its rival further because price would be below cost.  If both firms set price = marginal cost, neither firm has an incentive to deviate.

**Resolution of the Paradox:**

The Bertrand paradox arises from the strong assumptions of homogeneous products and perfect information.  In reality, product differentiation, capacity constraints, and repeated interaction can soften price competition and lead to prices above marginal cost in oligopoly.

### 8.4.3 Stackelberg Model: Leader-Follower Model

The **Stackelberg model** is a model of **sequential quantity competition** in which one firm (the leader) chooses its output level first, and then the other firm (the follower) observes the leader's output and chooses its output level.  It is a sequential game.

**Assumptions of the Stackelberg Model:**

*   **Two firms:** One leader and one follower.
*   **Homogeneous products:** Firms sell identical products.
*   **Sequential quantity choice:** The leader chooses its output first, and then the follower chooses its output after observing the leader's output.
*   **Market price determined by total quantity.**
*   **Firms maximize profit.**

**Stackelberg Equilibrium:**

In the Stackelberg equilibrium, the leader anticipates the follower's reaction to its output choice and chooses its output level to maximize its profit, taking into account the follower's reaction.  The follower behaves like a Cournot competitor, choosing its best response to the leader's output.

**(Imagine a diagram illustrating the Stackelberg game tree and equilibrium.)**

**First-Mover Advantage:**

The leader in the Stackelberg model has a **first-mover advantage**.  By choosing its output first, the leader can influence the follower's output choice and achieve a higher profit than the follower.  The leader typically produces a larger quantity and earns a higher profit than the follower, while the follower produces a smaller quantity and earns a lower profit.

**Outcome of Stackelberg Competition:**

*   **Output:** Total output in Stackelberg oligopoly is greater than in Cournot oligopoly and monopoly, but still less than in perfect competition.
*   **Price:** Price in Stackelberg oligopoly is lower than in Cournot oligopoly and monopoly, but still higher than in perfect competition.
*   **Profit:** The leader earns the highest profit, the follower earns a lower profit, and total industry profit is between Cournot oligopoly and perfect competition.

## 8.5 Collusion and Cartels: Cooperation for Monopoly Profits

**Collusion** is an agreement among firms in a market about quantities to produce or prices to charge.  **Cartel** is a formal organization of producers that agree to collude to restrict output and raise prices, acting like a monopoly.  Collusion and cartels are often illegal because they reduce competition and harm consumers.

**Incentive to Collude:**

Firms in oligopoly have an incentive to collude to increase their profits.  By colluding, oligopolists can act like a monopolist, restrict output, raise prices, and earn monopoly profits.  If oligopolists can successfully collude, they can achieve a joint outcome that is closer to monopoly and further away from competition, increasing their collective profits.

**Difficulties of Collusion:**

Collusion is often difficult to achieve and maintain due to several factors:

1.  **Antitrust Laws:**  Collusion is illegal in many countries, and firms that are caught colluding can face significant penalties (fines, imprisonment).  Antitrust laws deter explicit collusion.

2.  **Incentive to Cheat:**  Even if firms agree to collude, each firm has an incentive to cheat on the agreement by producing more than its agreed-upon quota or charging a lower price than the agreed-upon price.  Cheating can increase a firm's individual profit at the expense of other cartel members.  This is similar to the Prisoner's Dilemma.

3.  **Coordination Problems:**  It can be difficult to coordinate and enforce a collusive agreement among many firms, especially if products are differentiated or market conditions are changing.

4.  **Entry of New Firms:**  High profits earned by a cartel may attract new firms to enter the market, undermining the cartel's ability to restrict output and maintain high prices.

**Tacit Collusion:**

Even without explicit agreements, oligopolists may engage in **tacit collusion** – unspoken or implicit coordination of their actions to avoid aggressive competition and maintain prices at a profitable level.  Tacit collusion can take various forms, such as:

*   **Price Leadership:** One firm (the leader) sets the price, and other firms (followers) match the leader's price.
*   **Focal Points:** Firms may coordinate on a particular price or strategy that seems "natural" or obvious to all of them.
*   **Avoiding Price Competition:** Firms may compete on non-price dimensions (product differentiation, advertising, service) to avoid price wars.

Tacit collusion is more difficult to detect and prosecute than explicit collusion, but it can still reduce competition and harm consumers.

## 8.6 Antitrust Policy and Oligopolies: Promoting Competition

Because oligopolies can lead to reduced competition, higher prices, and lower output compared to perfect competition, governments use **antitrust policy** (also called competition policy) to promote competition and prevent anti-competitive practices in oligopolistic markets.

**Goals of Antitrust Policy:**

*   **Prevent monopolies and cartels:**  Prohibit the formation of monopolies and cartels that restrict competition.
*   **Promote competition:**  Encourage competition among firms to lower prices, increase output, and promote innovation.
*   **Protect consumers:**  Prevent firms from engaging in anti-competitive practices that harm consumers (e.g., price fixing, predatory pricing, mergers that reduce competition).

**Antitrust Laws and Tools:**

*   **Sherman Antitrust Act (US, 1890):**  Prohibits contracts, combinations, and conspiracies in restraint of trade, and monopolization.
*   **Clayton Act (US, 1914):**  Strengthened antitrust law by prohibiting specific practices like price discrimination, tying contracts, and mergers that reduce competition.
*   **Federal Trade Commission Act (US, 1914):**  Created the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to enforce antitrust laws and prevent unfair methods of competition.
*   **Merger Review:**  Antitrust authorities (e.g., FTC, Department of Justice in the US; European Commission in the EU) review proposed mergers and acquisitions to assess their potential impact on competition.  Mergers that are likely to substantially reduce competition may be blocked or require modifications (divestitures).
*   **Prohibition of Collusion and Price Fixing:**  Antitrust laws strictly prohibit explicit agreements among competitors to fix prices, restrict output, or divide markets.  Cartels are illegal.
*   **Regulation of Business Practices:**  Antitrust authorities may investigate and regulate business practices that are considered anti-competitive, such as predatory pricing, exclusive dealing, and tying arrangements.

**Challenges of Antitrust Policy in Oligopoly:**

*   **Defining Anti-competitive Behavior:**  It can be difficult to distinguish between legitimate competitive behavior and anti-competitive practices, especially in cases of tacit collusion or complex business strategies.
*   **Balancing Efficiency and Competition:**  Mergers can sometimes create efficiencies (economies of scale, synergies), but they can also reduce competition.  Antitrust authorities must weigh these trade-offs when reviewing mergers.
*   **Global Competition:**  In a globalized economy, antitrust policy must consider international competition and the behavior of multinational firms.

Antitrust policy plays a crucial role in maintaining a competitive environment in oligopolistic markets and protecting consumer welfare.  However, it is a complex and evolving area of law and economics.
