# Chapter 2: Supply and Demand: How Markets Work

## 2.1 Markets and Competition: Where Buyers and Sellers Meet

A **market** is a group of buyers and sellers of a particular good or service. Markets can take many forms. Sometimes they are highly organized, like the New York Stock Exchange, where buyers and sellers meet in a central location to trade stocks. More often, markets are less organized, like the market for ice cream in a city. In this market, buyers do not all meet together at one time, and sellers are in various locations and offer slightly different products.

**Competition** is a key feature of most markets. A **competitive market** is one in which there are many buyers and many sellers so that each has a negligible impact on the market price.  In perfectly competitive markets:

*   **Many Buyers and Sellers:**  No single buyer or seller can influence the market price.
*   **Homogeneous Products:** Goods offered for sale are largely the same.
*   **Free Entry and Exit:** Firms can freely enter or exit the market.
*   **Perfect Information:** Buyers and sellers have complete information about prices and products.

While perfect competition is a theoretical ideal, many markets are close to being competitive. The model of supply and demand is most applicable to competitive markets.

## 2.2 Demand: The Buyer's Side of the Market

**Demand** represents the desire and ability of consumers to purchase goods and services at various prices.  Let's break down the key concepts:

*   **Quantity Demanded:** The **quantity demanded** of a good or service is the amount that buyers are willing and able to purchase at a given price.

*   **Law of Demand:** The **law of demand** states that, other things being equal (ceteris paribus), the quantity demanded of a good falls when the price of the good rises, and vice versa.  In other words, there is an inverse relationship between price and quantity demanded.  Why does this happen?
    *   **Substitution Effect:** As the price of a good rises, consumers may switch to cheaper substitutes.
    *   **Income Effect:** As the price of a good rises, consumers' purchasing power decreases, leading them to buy less of the good (and potentially other goods as well).

*   **Demand Schedule and Demand Curve:**
    *   A **demand schedule** is a table that shows the quantity demanded at different prices.
    *   A **demand curve** is a graph of the relationship between price and quantity demanded.  By convention, the price is plotted on the vertical axis and quantity demanded on the horizontal axis.  Because of the law of demand, the demand curve slopes downwards.

    **(Imagine a table and a downward sloping curve here in the textbook)**

*   **Market Demand vs. Individual Demand:**
    *   **Individual demand** refers to the demand of a single consumer.
    *   **Market demand** is the sum of all individual demands for a particular good or service.  The market demand curve is derived by horizontally summing individual demand curves.

### 2.2.1 Factors Affecting Demand: Shifts vs. Movements Along the Demand Curve

It's crucial to distinguish between a **change in quantity demanded** and a **change in demand**.

*   **Change in Quantity Demanded:**  This refers to a movement *along* the demand curve. It is caused *only* by a change in the *price* of the good itself.  For example, if the price of coffee falls, consumers will buy more coffee, resulting in a movement *downwards* along the demand curve.

*   **Change in Demand:** This refers to a *shift* of the entire demand curve (either to the right or to the left). It is caused by changes in factors *other than* the price of the good itself, called **determinants of demand**. These factors include:
    *   **Income:**
        *   **Normal Goods:** Demand increases when income increases (e.g., steak, new cars).
        *   **Inferior Goods:** Demand decreases when income increases (e.g., instant noodles, used clothes).
    *   **Prices of Related Goods:**
        *   **Substitutes:** Two goods are substitutes if an increase in the price of one leads to an increase in the demand for the other (e.g., coffee and tea, Coke and Pepsi).
        *   **Complements:** Two goods are complements if an increase in the price of one leads to a decrease in the demand for the other (e.g., coffee and sugar, cars and gasoline).
    *   **Tastes (Preferences):** Changes in consumer tastes or preferences can affect demand (e.g., increased health consciousness might increase demand for organic food).
    *   **Expectations:** Consumer expectations about future prices or income can influence current demand (e.g., if consumers expect prices to rise in the future, they may increase their current demand).
    *   **Number of Buyers:** An increase in the number of buyers in the market will increase market demand.

    **(Imagine graphs showing shifts of the demand curve to the right and left here in the textbook)**

    *   **Shift to the Right (Increase in Demand):**  At every price, consumers want to buy a larger quantity.
    *   **Shift to the Left (Decrease in Demand):** At every price, consumers want to buy a smaller quantity.

## 2.3 Supply: The Seller's Side of the Market

**Supply** represents the willingness and ability of producers to offer goods and services for sale at various prices. Key concepts include:

*   **Quantity Supplied:** The **quantity supplied** of a good or service is the amount that sellers are willing and able to sell at a given price.

*   **Law of Supply:** The **law of supply** states that, other things being equal, the quantity supplied of a good rises when the price of the good rises, and vice versa. In other words, there is a direct relationship between price and quantity supplied. Why does this happen?
    *   **Profit Incentive:** Higher prices make production more profitable, encouraging firms to increase output.
    *   **Increasing Marginal Costs:** As firms produce more, they often face increasing marginal costs (the cost of producing one more unit). Higher prices are needed to cover these higher costs and incentivize increased production.

*   **Supply Schedule and Supply Curve:**
    *   A **supply schedule** is a table that shows the quantity supplied at different prices.
    *   A **supply curve** is a graph of the relationship between price and quantity supplied.  Because of the law of supply, the supply curve slopes upwards.

    **(Imagine a table and an upward sloping curve here in the textbook)**

*   **Market Supply vs. Individual Supply:**
    *   **Individual supply** refers to the supply of a single producer.
    *   **Market supply** is the sum of all individual supplies for a particular good or service. The market supply curve is derived by horizontally summing individual supply curves.

### 2.3.1 Factors Affecting Supply: Shifts vs. Movements Along the Supply Curve

Similar to demand, we distinguish between a **change in quantity supplied** and a **change in supply**.

*   **Change in Quantity Supplied:** This refers to a movement *along* the supply curve. It is caused *only* by a change in the *price* of the good itself. For example, if the price of coffee rises, coffee producers will supply more coffee, resulting in a movement *upwards* along the supply curve.

*   **Change in Supply:** This refers to a *shift* of the entire supply curve (either to the right or to the left). It is caused by changes in factors *other than* the price of the good itself, called **determinants of supply**. These factors include:
    *   **Input Prices:** The cost of inputs used in production (e.g., wages, raw materials, energy). Higher input prices decrease supply (shift supply curve to the left).
    *   **Technology:** Technological improvements can reduce production costs and increase supply (shift supply curve to the right).
    *   **Expectations:** Producer expectations about future prices can influence current supply (e.g., if producers expect prices to rise in the future, they may decrease current supply to sell more later).
    *   **Number of Sellers:** An increase in the number of sellers in the market will increase market supply.
    *   **Government Regulations and Taxes:** Regulations and taxes can increase production costs and decrease supply (shift supply curve to the left).
    *   **Subsidies:** Government subsidies can reduce production costs and increase supply (shift supply curve to the right).

    **(Imagine graphs showing shifts of the supply curve to the right and left here in the textbook)**

    *   **Shift to the Right (Increase in Supply):** At every price, producers are willing to sell a larger quantity.
    *   **Shift to the Left (Decrease in Supply):** At every price, producers are willing to sell a smaller quantity.

## 2.4 Market Equilibrium: Where Supply and Demand Intersect

**Equilibrium** in a market occurs when the quantity demanded equals the quantity supplied.  At this point:

*   **Equilibrium Price:** The price that balances quantity supplied and quantity demanded.  Also called the **market-clearing price** because at this price, all goods supplied are purchased.
*   **Equilibrium Quantity:** The quantity supplied and demanded at the equilibrium price.

Equilibrium is found graphically where the supply curve and the demand curve intersect.

**(Imagine a graph showing the intersection of supply and demand curves, with equilibrium price and quantity labeled)**

*   **Surplus:** If the market price is above the equilibrium price, quantity supplied exceeds quantity demanded, creating a **surplus** (excess supply).  Sellers will lower prices to eliminate the surplus, moving the market towards equilibrium.
*   **Shortage:** If the market price is below the equilibrium price, quantity demanded exceeds quantity supplied, creating a **shortage** (excess demand). Buyers will bid prices up, and sellers will raise prices, moving the market towards equilibrium.

The forces of supply and demand naturally push markets towards equilibrium.

## 2.5 Changes in Equilibrium: Analyzing Shifts in Supply and Demand

Equilibrium prices and quantities are not static. They change in response to shifts in supply or demand. We can use supply and demand analysis to predict how equilibrium changes when market conditions change.

### 2.5.1 Analyzing a Change in Demand

Suppose there is an increase in consumer income, and coffee is a normal good.

1.  **Demand Curve Shifts:**  Demand for coffee increases, so the demand curve shifts to the right.
2.  **Supply Curve Unchanged:** The supply curve remains unchanged because income is not a determinant of supply.
3.  **New Equilibrium:** The rightward shift of the demand curve leads to a new equilibrium with a higher equilibrium price and a higher equilibrium quantity.

**(Imagine graphs showing the shift in demand and the resulting change in equilibrium)**

### 2.5.2 Analyzing a Change in Supply

Suppose there is a technological improvement in coffee production.

1.  **Supply Curve Shifts:** Supply of coffee increases, so the supply curve shifts to the right.
2.  **Demand Curve Unchanged:** The demand curve remains unchanged because technology is not a determinant of demand.
3.  **New Equilibrium:** The rightward shift of the supply curve leads to a new equilibrium with a lower equilibrium price and a higher equilibrium quantity.

**(Imagine graphs showing the shift in supply and the resulting change in equilibrium)**

### 2.5.3 Simultaneous Shifts in Supply and Demand

When both supply and demand shift simultaneously, the analysis becomes slightly more complex. The change in equilibrium price and quantity will depend on:

*   **The direction of the shifts:** Are supply and demand increasing or decreasing?
*   **The relative magnitude of the shifts:** Is the shift in supply larger or smaller than the shift in demand?

For example, if both supply and demand increase:

*   **Quantity will definitely increase.**
*   **Price change is ambiguous:** If demand increases more than supply, price will rise. If supply increases more than demand, price will fall. If they increase by the same amount, price may remain unchanged.

**(Imagine examples and graphs illustrating different scenarios of simultaneous shifts)**

## 2.6 Elasticity: Measuring Responsiveness

**Elasticity** measures how much buyers and sellers respond to changes in market conditions. It is a unit-free measure, making it useful for comparing responsiveness across different markets.

### 2.6.1 Price Elasticity of Demand

**Price elasticity of demand** measures how much the quantity demanded responds to a change in price. It is calculated as:

```
Price Elasticity of Demand = (% Change in Quantity Demanded) / (% Change in Price)
```

*   **Elastic Demand:** Demand is elastic when price elasticity of demand is greater than 1.  Quantity demanded responds substantially to price changes.  Demand curve is relatively flat.
*   **Inelastic Demand:** Demand is inelastic when price elasticity of demand is less than 1. Quantity demanded responds weakly to price changes. Demand curve is relatively steep.
*   **Unit Elastic Demand:** Demand is unit elastic when price elasticity of demand is equal to 1. Percentage change in quantity demanded is equal to percentage change in price.
*   **Perfectly Elastic Demand:** Price elasticity of demand is infinite.  Demand curve is horizontal. Consumers will buy any quantity at a given price, but none at a higher price.
*   **Perfectly Inelastic Demand:** Price elasticity of demand is zero. Quantity demanded does not respond to price changes. Demand curve is vertical.

**(Imagine graphs illustrating different types of demand elasticity)**

**Determinants of Price Elasticity of Demand:**

*   **Availability of Close Substitutes:** Goods with close substitutes tend to have more elastic demand (e.g., pizza and burgers).
*   **Necessities vs. Luxuries:** Necessities tend to have inelastic demand (e.g., gasoline, basic food), while luxuries tend to have elastic demand (e.g., yachts, expensive vacations).
*   **Definition of the Market:** The more narrowly defined the market, the more elastic demand tends to be (e.g., demand for "ice cream" is more elastic than demand for "food").
*   **Time Horizon:** Demand tends to be more elastic in the long run than in the short run. Consumers have more time to adjust their consumption patterns in the long run.

### 2.6.2 Price Elasticity of Supply

**Price elasticity of supply** measures how much the quantity supplied responds to a change in price. It is calculated as:

```
Price Elasticity of Supply = (% Change in Quantity Supplied) / (% Change in Price)
```

*   **Elastic Supply:** Supply is elastic when price elasticity of supply is greater than 1. Quantity supplied responds substantially to price changes. Supply curve is relatively flat.
*   **Inelastic Supply:** Supply is inelastic when price elasticity of supply is less than 1. Quantity supplied responds weakly to price changes. Supply curve is relatively steep.
*   **Unit Elastic Supply:** Price elasticity of supply is equal to 1. Percentage change in quantity supplied is equal to percentage change in price.
*   **Perfectly Elastic Supply:** Price elasticity of supply is infinite. Supply curve is horizontal. Producers will supply any quantity at a given price, but none at a lower price.
*   **Perfectly Inelastic Supply:** Price elasticity of supply is zero. Quantity supplied does not respond to price changes. Supply curve is vertical.

**(Imagine graphs illustrating different types of supply elasticity)**

**Determinants of Price Elasticity of Supply:**

*   **Time Horizon:** Supply tends to be more elastic in the long run than in the short run. Firms have more time to adjust production capacity in the long run.
*   **Production Capacity:** Industries with excess capacity tend to have more elastic supply.
*   **Size of the Industry:** Smaller industries may have more elastic supply than larger industries.
*   **Availability of Inputs:** If inputs are readily available, supply tends to be more elastic.
*   **Inventory:** Firms with large inventories may have more elastic supply in the short run.

### 2.6.3 Income Elasticity of Demand

**Income elasticity of demand** measures how much the quantity demanded responds to a change in consumer income. It is calculated as:

```
Income Elasticity of Demand = (% Change in Quantity Demanded) / (% Change in Income)
```

*   **Normal Goods:** Income elasticity of demand is positive.
    *   **Income-Elastic Normal Goods:** Income elasticity of demand is greater than 1 (e.g., luxury goods).
    *   **Income-Inelastic Normal Goods:** Income elasticity of demand is between 0 and 1 (e.g., necessities).
*   **Inferior Goods:** Income elasticity of demand is negative.

### 2.6.4 Cross-Price Elasticity of Demand

**Cross-price elasticity of demand** measures how much the quantity demanded of one good responds to a change in the price of another good. It is calculated as:

```
Cross-Price Elasticity of Demand = (% Change in Quantity Demanded of Good A) / (% Change in Price of Good B)
```

*   **Substitutes:** Cross-price elasticity of demand is positive.
*   **Complements:** Cross-price elasticity of demand is negative.
*   **Independent Goods:** Cross-price elasticity of demand is zero or close to zero.

## 2.7 Applications of Supply and Demand: Price Controls, Taxes, and Subsidies

The tools of supply and demand are powerful for analyzing the effects of government policies and other events on markets. Let's look at a few applications.

### 2.7.1 Price Controls: Price Ceilings and Price Floors

**Price controls** are government interventions that attempt to set prices at levels different from the equilibrium price.

*   **Price Ceiling:** A legal maximum price on a good or service.
    *   **Example:** Rent control in some cities.
    *   **Binding Price Ceiling:** A price ceiling is binding if it is set *below* the equilibrium price. A binding price ceiling leads to a **shortage** because quantity demanded exceeds quantity supplied at the ceiling price.  It also leads to inefficient allocation, rationing, and potentially black markets.
    *   **Non-binding Price Ceiling:** A price ceiling set *above* the equilibrium price has no effect because the market equilibrium price is already below the ceiling.

    **(Imagine graphs illustrating binding and non-binding price ceilings)**

*   **Price Floor:** A legal minimum price on a good or service.
    *   **Example:** Minimum wage.
    *   **Binding Price Floor:** A price floor is binding if it is set *above* the equilibrium price. A binding price floor leads to a **surplus** because quantity supplied exceeds quantity demanded at the floor price. It can also lead to inefficient allocation and wasted resources.
    *   **Non-binding Price Floor:** A price floor set *below* the equilibrium price has no effect because the market equilibrium price is already above the floor.

    **(Imagine graphs illustrating binding and non-binding price floors)**

### 2.7.2 Taxes

Governments use taxes to raise revenue and to influence market outcomes. Let's consider the effect of a tax on a good.

*   **Tax on Buyers:** If a tax is levied on buyers, it effectively shifts the demand curve *downwards* by the amount of the tax.  The equilibrium price *paid by buyers* rises, the equilibrium price *received by sellers* falls, and the equilibrium quantity decreases.
*   **Tax on Sellers:** If a tax is levied on sellers, it effectively shifts the supply curve *upwards* by the amount of the tax. The equilibrium price *paid by buyers* rises, the equilibrium price *received by sellers* falls, and the equilibrium quantity decreases.

**Key Result:**  The economic incidence of a tax (who bears the burden of the tax) is the same whether the tax is levied on buyers or sellers.  The tax burden is shared between buyers and sellers, and the relative burden depends on the price elasticities of demand and supply.

*   **Tax Burden and Elasticity:**
    *   Tax burden falls more heavily on the side of the market that is *less elastic*.
    *   If demand is more inelastic than supply, buyers bear a larger share of the tax burden.
    *   If supply is more inelastic than demand, sellers bear a larger share of the tax burden.

**(Imagine graphs illustrating the effects of taxes on buyers and sellers, and how elasticity affects tax burden)**

### 2.7.3 Subsidies

A **subsidy** is a government payment to buyers or sellers, designed to encourage consumption or production. Subsidies are the opposite of taxes.

*   **Subsidy to Buyers:** A subsidy to buyers effectively shifts the demand curve *upwards* by the amount of the subsidy. The equilibrium price *paid by buyers* falls, the equilibrium price *received by sellers* rises, and the equilibrium quantity increases.
*   **Subsidy to Sellers:** A subsidy to sellers effectively shifts the supply curve *downwards* by the amount of the subsidy. The equilibrium price *paid by buyers* falls, the equilibrium price *received by sellers* rises, and the equilibrium quantity increases.

**Key Result:** Similar to taxes, the economic incidence of a subsidy is the same whether the subsidy is given to buyers or sellers. The benefit of the subsidy is shared between buyers and sellers, and the relative benefit depends on the price elasticities of demand and supply.

*   **Subsidy Benefit and Elasticity:**
    *   Subsidy benefit accrues more to the side of the market that is *less elastic*.
    *   If demand is more inelastic than supply, buyers receive a larger share of the subsidy benefit.
    *   If supply is more inelastic than demand, sellers receive a larger share of the subsidy benefit.

**(Imagine graphs illustrating the effects of subsidies on buyers and sellers, and how elasticity affects subsidy benefit)**

## Chapter 2 Summary

This chapter has introduced the fundamental concepts of supply and demand, which are the foundation of microeconomic analysis:

*   **Demand** is determined by consumer willingness and ability to pay, and is influenced by price, income, prices of related goods, tastes, expectations, and number of buyers.
*   **Supply** is determined by producer willingness and ability to sell, and is influenced by price, input prices, technology, expectations, number of sellers, regulations, and subsidies.
*   **Market equilibrium** occurs where quantity demanded equals quantity supplied, determining the equilibrium price and quantity.
*   **Changes in demand and supply** lead to changes in equilibrium price and quantity.
*   **Elasticity** measures the responsiveness of quantity demanded or supplied to changes in price, income, or prices of related goods.
*   **Price controls** (ceilings and floors) can lead to shortages or surpluses and inefficient allocation.
*   **Taxes** and **subsidies** affect market equilibrium and create a wedge between the price paid by buyers and the price received by sellers. The burden of taxes and the benefit of subsidies are shared based on the relative elasticities of supply and demand.

In the next chapter, we will delve deeper into **consumer behavior** and explore the underlying principles behind the demand curve.
