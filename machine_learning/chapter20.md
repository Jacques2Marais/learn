    *   **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD):**  Calculates gradients using a single randomly chosen training example (or a small batch) in each iteration.  Faster and can escape local minima better than Batch GD.
    *   **Mini-batch Gradient Descent:**  Compromise between Batch GD and SGD, using small batches of training examples to calculate gradients.  Most commonly used in practice.
