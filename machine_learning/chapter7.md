# Chapter 7:  Discovering Shopping Secrets with Association Rule Mining - What Goes With What?

Welcome back! We've learned how to group data with Clustering and simplify it with Dimensionality Reduction. Now, let's explore a different kind of Unsupervised Learning: **Association Rule Mining**.

Imagine you're a supermarket manager. You have tons of transaction data - what items customers buy together. You want to find out if there are any interesting **associations** between items.  Do people who buy diapers also tend to buy beer? (Turns out, sometimes they do!).  That's what Association Rule Mining helps you discover!

## What is Association Rule Mining?  Finding Relationships in Transactions - Rules of What Goes With What

**Association Rule Mining** is a technique used to discover interesting relationships or associations between items in transactional datasets.  Transactional data is data where each record represents a transaction (e.g., a shopping basket, a website visit, a medical record), and contains a set of items.

**Association Rule Mining is used when you want to answer questions like:**

*   What items are frequently purchased together in a supermarket? (Market Basket Analysis)
*   What products are often viewed together on an e-commerce website?
*   What symptoms are often observed together in patients with a certain disease?
*   What words or phrases tend to co-occur in documents?
*   What services are often used together by customers?

See? We're finding rules about what items are associated with each other in transactions!

## Apriori Algorithm:  Mining Frequent Itemsets - Finding the Building Blocks of Rules

The **Apriori Algorithm** is a classic and widely used algorithm for Association Rule Mining.  It's designed to efficiently find **frequent itemsets** in transactional data.  Frequent itemsets are sets of items that appear together in transactions frequently enough to meet a certain threshold.

**Key Concepts in Association Rule Mining:**

*   **Itemset:** A set of items.  For example, {Bread, Milk, Butter} is an itemset of size 3 (3-itemset).
*   **Transaction:** A set of items purchased together in a single transaction.  For example, a transaction might be {Bread, Milk, Diapers}.
*   **Support Count:** The number of transactions that contain a particular itemset.
*   **Support:** The fraction of transactions that contain a particular itemset.  `Support(Itemset) = Support Count(Itemset) / Total Number of Transactions`.
*   **Frequent Itemset:** An itemset whose support is greater than or equal to a pre-defined minimum support threshold (**min_support**).

**Apriori Principle:**  A crucial principle that Apriori algorithm relies on:  **If an itemset is frequent, then all of its subsets must also be frequent.**  Conversely, **if an itemset is infrequent, then all of its supersets must also be infrequent.**  This principle helps to prune the search space and make the algorithm efficient.

**Steps of Apriori Algorithm:**

1.  **Set min_support threshold:**  Decide on the minimum support value to consider an itemset frequent.
2.  **Generate frequent 1-itemsets:**  Count the support of each item (1-itemset).  Keep only those items that meet the min_support threshold.
3.  **Iteratively generate frequent k-itemsets (k=2, 3, ...):**
    *   **Candidate generation:**  Use the frequent (k-1)-itemsets found in the previous iteration to generate candidate k-itemsets.  Apriori principle is used here to efficiently generate candidates (only join frequent (k-1)-itemsets that share a prefix of length k-2).
    *   **Candidate pruning:**  Prune candidate k-itemsets that have any infrequent (k-1)-itemset subset (using Apriori principle again).
    *   **Support counting:**  Scan the transaction database to count the support of each candidate k-itemset.
    *   **Frequent itemset selection:**  Keep only those candidate k-itemsets that meet the min_support threshold.
4.  **Repeat step 3 until no more frequent itemsets can be generated.**

**Output of Apriori Algorithm:**  A set of frequent itemsets for different sizes (1-itemsets, 2-itemsets, 3-itemsets, etc.).  These frequent itemsets are the building blocks for generating association rules.

## Market Basket Analysis:  Unveiling Shopping Patterns - What Customers Buy Together

**Market Basket Analysis** is a classic application of Association Rule Mining in retail.  It aims to discover associations between items that are frequently purchased together by customers in shopping transactions.

**Using Apriori for Market Basket Analysis:**

1.  **Prepare transactional data:**  Each transaction represents a customer's shopping basket, containing a list of items purchased.
2.  **Run Apriori algorithm:**  Apply Apriori algorithm to the transactional data to find frequent itemsets.
3.  **Generate association rules from frequent itemsets:**  For each frequent itemset, generate association rules of the form:  **If {antecedent} then {consequent}**.
    *   **Antecedent:**  The itemset on the left-hand side of the rule (e.g., {Bread, Milk}).
    *   **Consequent:** The itemset on the right-hand side of the rule (e.g., {Butter}).

**Evaluating Association Rules:**  We need metrics to evaluate the interestingness and strength of association rules.  Common metrics include:

*   **Support:**  Support of the complete rule {Antecedent âˆª Consequent}.  Measures how frequently the rule applies to transactions.
*   **Confidence:**  Conditional probability of seeing the consequent given the antecedent.  `Confidence(Rule) = Support(Rule) / Support(Antecedent)`.  Measures how often the consequent appears when the antecedent is present.
*   **Lift:**  Measures how much more often the antecedent and consequent occur together than we would expect if they were independent.  `Lift(Rule) = Confidence(Rule) / Support(Consequent)`.  Lift > 1 indicates a positive association, Lift < 1 indicates a negative association, Lift = 1 indicates no association (independence).
*   **Conviction:**  Measures how much the rule would be mistaken if the implication was just due to chance.  `Conviction(Rule) = (1 - Support(Consequent)) / (1 - Confidence(Rule))`.  High conviction value means that the rule is highly interesting.

**Using Association Rules for Business Decisions:**

*   **Product Placement:**  Place associated items together in stores or websites to encourage cross-selling.
*   **Recommendations:**  Recommend associated items to customers based on their current shopping basket or browsing history.
*   **Promotions and Bundling:**  Create targeted promotions or bundles for associated items.
*   **Inventory Management:**  Optimize inventory based on frequently purchased item combinations.
*   **Customer Segmentation:**  Segment customers based on their purchasing patterns and associated item preferences.
